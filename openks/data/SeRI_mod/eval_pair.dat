It is also considered for the Paraguayans as their war for independence.  The first battles were fought in [[Battle of Campichuelo|Campichuelo]] and [[Battle of Campo Maracana|Maracana]] and the Argentines claimed victory in both fields. However, they were completely vanquished in the subsequent battles of [[Battle of Paraguarí|Paraguarí]] and [[Battle of Tacuarí|Tacuarí]].

-1	Peloponnesian War	|||	Battle of Mantinea (418 BC)	|||	The [[Battle of Mantinea (418 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] was the largest land battle fought within Greece during the Peloponnesian War. The Lacedaemonians, with their neighbors the Tegeans, faced the combined armies of Argos, Athens, Mantinea, and [[Arcadia]]. In the battle, the allied coalition scored early successes, but failed to capitalize on them, which allowed the Spartan elite forces to defeat the forces opposite them. The result was a complete victory for the Spartans, which rescued their city from the brink of strategic defeat. The democratic alliance was broken up, and most of its members were reincorporated into the Peloponnesian League. With its victory at Mantinea, Sparta pulled itself back from the brink of utter defeat, and re-established its hegemony throughout the Peloponnese.	|||	 Peace of Nicias 	|||		|||

Lefebvre and Marshal [[Claude Victor-Perrin]] offered a careless chase that ended in humiliation at the [[Battle of Valmaseda]], where their scattered troops were handled by La Romana's repatriated Spanish veterans and escaped to safety. The campaign in the south, where Napoleon's main army overran the unprotected Spanish centre in a devastating attack near [[Battle of Burgos|Burgos]], ended quickly. The Spanish militias{{mdash}}untrained and unable to form [[infantry square]]s{{mdash}}scattered in the face of massed French cavalry, while the [[Spanish Royal Guard]] and [[Walloon Guards]] stood their ground in vain and were overcome by [[Antoine Charles Louis Lasalle]] and his ''sabreurs''.

Blake's isolated army reversed direction on 17 November and dug in at the [[Battle of Espinosa]]. His lines repelled French attacks over a day and night of vicious fighting, before giving up the next day. Blake again outmarched Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] and escaped with a rump army to Santander, but the Spanish front had been fragmented and the Imperial armies raced forward over undefended provinces.

-1	Second Anglo-Dutch War	|||	Battle of Nevis	|||	The Second Anglo-Dutch war had spread to the [[Caribbean]] islands in 1665 and the English had been quick to capture the Dutch island of [[Sint Eustatius]]. A French declaration of war on the side of the Dutch in mid April 1666 took the situation a step further and buoyed a Dutch counterattack. Quickly the French under [[Joseph-Antoine de La Barre]] took over the English Caribbean islands offsetting English control. First the English half of St Kitts fell, quickly followed by [[Antigua]] and [[Montserrat]]. The Dutch meanwhile under Admiral [[Abraham Crijnssen]] had reconquered the island of Sint Eustatius and following that captured [[Suriname]]. With the Caribbean clearly in Franco-Dutch control Abraham Crijnssen and de La Barre combined forces and agreed to a Franco-Dutch invasion of [[Nevis]] on 20 May 1667. However, [[Battle of Nevis|this invasion was repelled]] by the English in a confused naval action. After this failed attack and the fallout that followed, the French, under Admiral Joseph de la Barre, moved to Martinique.

Eugene, who was accompanied by [[Frederick II of Prussia|Crown Prince Frederick]] of [[Prussia]], made some attempts to relieve the siege, but never made any decisive attacks against the besieging army owing to its size and relatively poor quality of the troops under his command.

However, a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, [[barbed wire]], and [[artillery]] repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counter-attacking defenders. As a result, no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the [[Battle of Verdun]], in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties (estimated), the [[Battle of the Somme]], also in 1916, with more than a million casualties (estimated), and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], in 1917, with roughly 600,000 casualties (estimated).	|||		|||		|||

This [[Second Battle of Ypres]] was intended to divert attention from offensives in the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] while disrupting Franco-British planning and to test a new weapon: the second mass use of [[chemical weapons]]. (Ypres is frequently cited as the first use of gas but this had occurred at [[Battle of Bolimów|Bolimow]], on the Eastern Front.)

When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the [[Siege of Derry]] began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained.

However defending on interior lines and with control of the lines of communication they could still shift forces and launch local offensives to damage Chinese forces or mop up guerrillas in the rear areas.

The government responded by saying Liberty Square would be off-limits due to 'sports and cultural events'. The HAK said it planned to rally in the square regardless of whether the city government and the national government allowed it to do so. Political analysts said national opposition leaders like Ter-Petrosyan were harnessing an existing wave of unrest inspired by the [[Tunisian Revolution]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|protests]] in [[Egypt]] and evident in such events as the ongoing street vendor protests, with some predicting that the conditions were right for major protests to gain traction.	|||	Timeline of protests	|||	Political protests	|||

0	Battle for Velikiye Luki	|||	Battle of Stalingrad	|||	The battle is sometimes called 'The Little Stalingrad of the North' due to its similarities with the larger and better-known [[Battle of Stalingrad]] that raged simultaneously in the southern sector of the front. Judged purely by the numbers, this battle was a small affair by the usual standards of the Eastern Front (150,000 total casualties suffered by both sides as opposed to 2,000,000 total casualties at Stalingrad), but had enormous strategic consequences. The liberation of Velikiye Luki meant the Red Army had, for the first time since October 1941, a direct rail supply line to the northern face of the Rzhev Salient exposing the German troops defending Rzhev to encirclement. Events at Velikiye Luki thus necessitated the withdrawal from Rzhev salient ending any German military threat to Moscow.  However, even after withdrawing from Rzhev, possession of Velikiye Luki meant that the rail link between Army groups North and Centre was severed, preventing the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] from shifting reinforcements between threatened sectors. Furthermore, the rail lines from Velikiye Luki led directly into the rear of [[Vitebsk]], a critical logistics hub for Army Group Centre. The effects of this battle meant that Army Group Centre was exposed to attack from the north, east, and (after the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)]]) south, exposing the whole army group to mass encirclement, which is exactly what happened in the massive [[Operation Bagration]] the following year.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

Following the collapse of the Iraqi government, a number of [[Shi'ite]] Islamist groups, including the [[Sadrist Trend]] led by [[Muqtada al-Sadr]], the [[Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council]] and [[Islamic Virtue Party|Fadhila]], were able to expand their influence in Basra, solidifying their standing following the January 2005 elections. Basra became a center of smuggling activity in Iraq, including cigarette smuggling, opium from Afghanistan which transits Iran, oil and gas smuggling, illegal weapons, and other criminal rackets. Violence steadily increased as the three parties vied for control of Basra's resources, continuing through 2005 and 2006. At the same time, attacks on British forces increased following the use of highly sophisticated [[explosively formed penetrators]] (EFPs) smuggled in by Iran   restricting the British to their bases, which militia then targeted with rocket and mortar fire on a regular basis.

0	Battle of Camden	|||	Battles of Saratoga	|||	Following the British [[Battles of Saratoga|defeat at Saratoga]] in 1777 and French entry into the [[American Revolutionary War]] in early 1778, the British decided to renew a '[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|southern strategy]]' to win back their rebellious North American colonies.  This campaign began in December 1778 with the [[Capture of Savannah|capture of Savannah, Georgia]], and gained further ground in January 1780, when General [[Henry Clinton (1730–1795)|Sir Henry Clinton]] led an army and [[Siege of Charleston|captured Charleston, South Carolina]].  Clinton returned to New York in the summer of 1780, leaving Lord Cornwallis the task of fortifying the South and raising the anticipated large numbers of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]].  The [[Continental Army]] in the south, most of which had surrendered at Charleston, was completely driven from [[South Carolina]] in the May 1780 [[Battle of Waxhaws]].	|||	Background	|||		|||

The next day, he attacked Sher Singh's bridgehead on the left bank of the Chenab at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]] but was repulsed, raising Sikh morale. On 1 December, a cavalry division under Major General [[Joseph Thackwell]] crossed the Chenab upstream from Ramnagar. Sher Singh advanced against him, resulting in a day-long artillery duel at Sadullapur. Gough meanwhile bombarded the empty Sikh positions at Ramnagar, and postponed a general attack until the next day. During the night, Sher Singh withdrew to the north.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||
0	Battle of Chongju (1950)	|||	Battle of Pakchon	|||	During the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the [[People's Volunteer Army]] across the Yalu River under the overall command of Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]] in order to reinforce the remnants of the KPA. Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence, the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to {{convert|100|km|mi}} into North Korea, and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group; in total 30 divisions composed of 380,000 men.  Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted to resume command of 3 RAR following Green's death, however he was relieved of his position by Coad just six days later in the wake of the [[Battle of Pakchon]] on 5 November that cost the battalion heavily, losing 12 killed and 64 wounded despite killing 200 Chinese.

0	Battle of Cold Harbor	|||	Battle of Chancellorsville	|||	Some authors (Catton, Esposito, Foote, McPherson, Grimsley) estimate the casualties for the major assault on June 3 and all agree on approximately 7,000 total Union casualties, 1,500 Confederate. Gordon Rhea, considered the preeminent modern historian of Grant's Overland campaign, has examined casualty lists in detail and has published a contrarian view in his 2002 book, ''Cold Harbor''. For the morning assault on June 3, he can account for only 3,500 to 4,000 Union killed, wounded, and missing, and estimates that for the entire day the Union suffered about 6,000 casualties, compared to Lee's 1,000 to 1,500. Rhea noted that although this was a horrific loss, Grant's main attack on June 3 was dwarfed by Lee's daily losses at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and [[Pickett's Charge]], and is comparable to [[Battle of Malvern Hill|Malvern Hill]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Coral–Balmoral	|||	Operation Coburg	|||	The [[Tet Offensive|Tet offensive]] began on 31 January 1968, with 85,000 to 100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops simultaneously assaulting population centres and allied installations across South Vietnam in an attempt to incite a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government and its American supporters. In response, 1 ATF was deployed along likely infiltration routes in order to defend the vital [[Bien Hoa]]-[[Long Binh]] complex near [[Saigon]] between January and March, as part of [[Operation Coburg]]. Heavy fighting resulted in 17 Australians killed and 61 wounded, while communist casualties included at least 145 killed, 110 wounded and five captured, with many more removed from the battlefield.  Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy were stretched thin, with elements of 3 RAR successfully repelling an assault on [[Ba Ria]] and later spoiling a harassing attack on [[Long Dien]] and conducting a sweep of Hoa Long, killing 50 Viet Cong and wounding 25 for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded.	|||	Background	|||	Military situation	|||

0	Battle of Culloden	|||	Battle of Prestonpans	|||	[[Charles Edward Stuart]], known as 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' or the 'Young Pretender', arrived in Scotland in 1745 to incite a rebellion of Stuart sympathizers against the House of Hanover. He successfully raised forces, mainly of [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highland]] [[Scottish clan|clansmen]], and slipped past the [[House of Hanover|Hanover]]ian stationed in [[Scotland]] and defeated a force of [[militiamen]] at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. The city of [[Edinburgh]] was occupied, but the castle held out and most of the Scottish population remained hostile to the rebels; others, while sympathetic, were reluctant to lend overt support to a movement whose chances were unproven. The British government recalled forces from the [[War of the Austrian Succession|war with France in Flanders]] to deal with the rebellion.	|||	Background	|||		|||

He was seeking a return to a policy of attacks on Spanish trade and shipping routes, whose success in the time [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] had acquired a legendary status.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Dachen Archipelago	|||	Battle of Yijiangshan Islands	|||	The Communists had already targeted Dachen Archipelago when they attacked [[Yijiangshan Islands]], but the Communists were incapable of simultaneously taking both.  When the Communists bombed Dachen Archipelago during the [[Battle of Yijiangshan Islands]], it was mainly to prevent the Nationalist garrison of Dachen Archipelago from reinforcing [[Yijiangshan Islands]].  In fact, from November 1, 1954 to November 4, 1954, the Communist air force flew 49 sorties to bomb Dachen Archipelago, but none of the 721 bombs dropped hit their intended targets.  On November 10, 1954, the Communist bombers flew 28 sorties and communist fighters flew 46 sorties in support of the bombers to strike Nationalist warships in the Dachen Archipelago, but only resulted in minor damages of a mere five warships.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||
0	Battle of Doberdò	|||	Sixth Battle of the Isonzo	|||	The battle, which was part of the [[Sixth Battle of the Isonzo]], took place on a strategic area the westernmost edge of the [[Kras]] plateau. The Italians, who conquered the lowland area around [[Monfalcone]] and [[Ronchi dei Legionari|Ronchi]], tried to force themselves over the Kras Plateau in order to gain control over the main road linking the port city of [[Trieste]] to the town of [[Gorizia]]. After fierce fighting and huge casualties, they succeeded in their attempts. The Austro-Hungarian forces retreated and Gorizia fell to the Italians. They, however, didn't succeed in forcing their way to Trieste, and were stopped north-west of [[Duino]].	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Dresden	|||	Battle of Kulm	|||	The '''Battle of Dresden''' was fought on 26–27 August 1813 around [[Dresden]], Germany,  resulting in a French victory under [[Napoleon]] against forces of the [[Sixth Coalition]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]ns, [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]ns and [[Prussia]]ns under [[Field Marshal]] [[Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg|Schwartzenberg]]. However, Napoleon's victory was not as complete as it could have been.

0	Battle of Dürenstein	|||	Battle of Emmendingen	|||	The loss of Schmitt was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, he was arguably their most experienced general staff officer, other than the Archduke Charles. From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles']] staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at [[Battle of Emmendingen|Emmendingen]], [[Battle of Schliengen|Schliengen]], the sieges at [[siege of Kehl (1796)|Kehl and Hünigen]], the battles at [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] and [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at [[Battle of Winterthur (1799)|Winterthur]] and [[First Battle of Zurich|Zürich]]. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] than his eventual replacement, [[Franz von Weyrother]]. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessed of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, but it would have mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Dürenstein	|||	Battle of Waterloo	|||	In a series of conflicts from 1803 to 1815 known as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], various European powers formed five coalitions against the [[First French Empire]]. Like the wars sparked by the [[French Revolution]] (1789), these further revolutionized the formation, organization, and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to [[Levée en masse|mass conscription]]. Under the leadership of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], French power rose quickly, as the ''[[Grande Armée]]'' conquered most of Europe and it collapsed rapidly after the disastrous [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–1814 campaigns, resulting in the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration of the Bourbon monarchy]] in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the [[Hundred Days]], his defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication, and his banishment to the Island of [[Saint Helena]], concluded the Napoleonic Wars.	|||	Background	|||		|||

In 1741, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies, intent on capturing Vienna, by painting drain pipes to look like cannons, and beating on drums, thus suggesting the presence of a large force.	|||	Battlefield commemorations	|||		|||

0	Battle of Fort Eben-Emael	|||	Battle of France	|||	The '''Battle of Fort Eben-Emael''' was a battle between [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces that took place between 10 May and 11 May 1940, and was part of the [[Battle of Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|Fall Gelb]], the German invasion of the [[Low Countries]] and [[France]]. An assault force of German ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' was tasked with assaulting and capturing [[Fort Eben-Emael]], a Belgian fortress whose artillery pieces dominated several important bridges over the [[Albert Canal]] that German forces intended to use to advance into [[Belgium]]. As some of the German airborne troops assaulted the fortress and disabled the garrison and the artillery pieces inside it, others simultaneously captured three bridges over the Canal. Having disabled the fortress, the airborne troops were then ordered to protect the bridges against Belgian counter-attacks until they linked up with ground forces from the German [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]].	|||		|||		|||

Union forces conducted major operations in 1862 and 1863 to capture Charleston, first overland on James Island (the [[Battle of Secessionville]], June 1862), then by naval assault against Fort Sumter (the [[First Battle of Charleston Harbor]], April 1863), then by seizing the Confederate artillery positions on Morris Island (beginning with the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], July 1863, and followed by a siege until September). After pounding Sumter to rubble with artillery fire, a final amphibious operation attempted to occupy it (the [[Second Battle of Fort Sumter]], September 1863), but was repulsed and no further attempts were made. The Confederates evacuated Fort Sumter and Charleston in February 1865 as Union Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] outflanked the city in the [[Carolinas Campaign]]. On April 14, 1865, four years to the day after lowering the [[Fort Sumter Flag]] in surrender, Robert Anderson (by then a [[Major general (United States)|major general]], although ill and in retired status) returned to the ruined fort to raise the flag he had lowered in 1861.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

Reflecting that belief, much of the material intended to protect the city was sent to strongpoints on the Mississippi, such as [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island Number 10]], [[Fort Pillow]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The immediate vicinity of the city was actually weakened as guns were withdrawn for use in distant campaigns, as for example that leading to the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

Radio communication between tanks and infantry was poor and there was little combined arms coordination as practiced by the Germans. In the end, hastily set up German defences (including [[8.8 cm FlaK 18/36/37/41|{{convert|88|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} ''FlaK'' gun]]s and [[10.5 cm leFH 18|{{convert|105|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} field gun]]s) stopped the attack.

The main resistance came from the Belgian 1st ''[[Chasseurs Ardennais]]'' along with the [[5th Light Cavalry Division (France)|5th French Light Cavalry Division (DLC)]].  Although Gamelin was well aware of the situation, the French bomber force was far too weak to challenge German air superiority so close to the German border.

This they did, but found themselves besieged in the hastily constructed base, at a deserted [[Norway|Norwegian]] mission station. A relief column was organised, and under the leadership of [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] it departed [[Fort Tenedos]] on 29 March to march to Pearson's relief. The column composed 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans, and a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders (4 kg), four 24-pounder (11 kg) rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s.  The progress was slow, as Chelmsford took a roundabout route to avoid ambush in the close country Pearson had previously passed through. In addition, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains and fearing a repeat of [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]], Chelmsford ensured his men spent much time [[laager]]ing and entrenching their camp at the end of each day.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||

The action occurred on May 7, 1861, three weeks after the start of the [[American Civil War]] (Civil War) at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in the harbor at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on April 14, 1861. The Gloucester Point engagement is notable as the earliest exchange of gunfire between the [[Union Navy]] and organized Rebel (Confederate) forces after the U.S. Army surrendered Fort Sumter to the Confederates and as the earliest reported Civil War military engagement in Virginia. Like other early engagements between Union gunboats and Confederate shore batteries, the battle at Gloucester Point was part of the Union Navy effort to [[blockade]] the Southern States in general and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in particular. The engagement also was part of the effort by Confederate forces to deny the use of rivers in [[Virginia]] to Union military and commercial traffic.	|||		|||		|||

On 22 November at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]], his cavalry were repulsed attacking a Sikh bridgehead on the east bank of the Chenab. Then on 13 January 1849, he launched a hasty frontal attack against Sher Singh's army at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] near the [[Jhelum River]] and was driven back with heavy casualties.

0	Battle of Hegra Fortress	|||	Battles of Narvik	|||	One way that Holtermann wanted to directly support the main war effort in Norway was to bombard Værnes Air Base, the northernmost airfield in German hands and vital for the support of German forces north of Trondheim. This was particularly so for the [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik front]], which could not be reached by aircraft flying from further south than Værnes. Recognising this, the Germans had hired some 2,000 Norwegian [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] labourers to work full-time at expanding and improving the air strip. Bombarding Værnes would both have disrupted this work and impaired the bombing raids being flown against Norwegian forces fighting further to the north. However, since Værnes is {{convert|11.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Hegra, and the fortress' guns only had a maximum range of some {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, this was impossible. For accurate firing, the effective range was a mere {{convert|6.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as that was the range of the artillery's height angle meter.  Even though no modifications could be carried out, one of the 10.5 cm guns at Hegra opened fire in the direction of Værnes on 22 April. With the gun firing at maximum elevation, the rounds still fell hundreds of metres short of their intended target.	|||	Battle	|||	Siege	|||	Artillery duels, aerial bombing and patrol engagements

On the same morning as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the U.S. naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]], forces of the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked [[British Hong Kong]].  The attack was in violation of international law as Japan had not declared war against the [[British Empire]].  Japan's unprovoked act of aggression was met with stiff resistance from Hong Kong's garrison, composed of local troops as well as [[British Army during the Second World War|British]], [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canadian]] and [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian]] units.

0	Battle of Höchstädt (1800)	|||	Battle of Hohenlinden	|||	The campaign culminating in Kray's evacuation of Ulm was one of Moreau's most resounding triumphs. Napoleon Bonaparte had given Moreau specific instructions about the conduct of the campaign, all of which Moreau had ignored. Regardless, their combined efforts damaged Habsburg military operations.  In Spring 1800, while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany, [[Massena]] and [[Desaix]] ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy. Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]]. The battle near Höchstädt, five days after the Austrian disaster at Marengo, allowed the French to take Munich. The combined efforts forced the Habsburgs to accept an armistice ended hostilities for the rest of the summer, but the French extracted massive levies on the Bavarians. Despite these significant losses—both of them decisive—the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms.  In mid-November, the French ended the truce and Moreau inflicted another significant and decisive defeat at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] on 3 December 1800.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

0	Battle of Jaffa (1917)	|||	Battle of Mughar Ridge	|||	The port of [[Jaffa]] had been occupied by the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]] on the 16 November, as a result of the victory gained by that brigade and the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge|Ayun Kara]] two days before, but the Ottoman forces were only {{convert|3|mi}} away across the [[Auju River]] (Yarkon River), the mouth of which is known as the Nahr-el-Auja. The closeness of the Ottoman army made the port and town unusable to shipping, still being within range of Ottoman artillery.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Jemappes	|||	Battle of Neerwinden (1793)	|||	Dumouriez, intent on invading the [[Austrian Netherlands]], advanced late in the season and attacked the Austrians with greatly superior forces. Jemappes was won by costly but effective charges against the Austrians' prepared position. Dumouriez overran the Austrian Netherlands within a month, but lost it at the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]] in March. The French would not reconquer the Austrian Netherlands until the summer of 1794.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Jobourg	|||	Battle of Trafalgar	|||	By the end of October 1813 the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] was in its final stages; [[Emperor Napoleon]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] by the Allied European armies and was retreating to the borders of France,  while the British army under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Lord Wellington]] had crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and was advancing on [[Toulouse]]. The French Navy had never recovered from defeat at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 and had made no serious effort to put to sea since the abortive attempt which ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Basque Roads]] in 1809.	|||	Background	|||		|||

The French garrison of 18,675 men surrendered and was released on the promise of not fighting the Coalition for one year. The French government immediately sent the released troops to fight in the internal [[War in the Vendée]]. During the siege, the French suffered approximately 4,000 casualties while the Coalition lost about 3,000.	|||	Prologue	|||		|||
0	Battle of Kambula	|||	Battle of Isandlwana	|||	Wood also now received information that the impi was nearly 20,000 men strong, consisting of regiments that had already defeated the British at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] and other battles and that many of the Zulus were armed with rifles taken from the British dead at these battles. Shortly after this the Zulu impi was sighted 5 miles away across the plain, coming on due westwards in five columns. However, the warriors of the impi had not eaten for three days.  The woodcutters and cattle were brought back in and, confident that the defences could be manned within a minute and a half of an alarm being sounded, Wood ordered the men to have their dinners.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||
0	Battle of Kehl (1796)	|||	Siege of Kehl (1703)	|||	Although separated politically and geographically, the fates of Kehl, a village on the eastern shore of the Rhine in [[Baden-Durlach]], and those of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] city of [[Strasbourg]], on the western shore, were united by the presence of bridges and a series of gates, fortifications and [[Barrage (dam)|barrage dam]]s that allowed passage across the river. In the 1790s, the Rhine was wild, unpredictable, and difficult to cross, in some places more than four or more times wider than it is in the twenty-first century, even under non-flood conditions. Its channels and tributaries wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons. The fortifications at Kehl and Strasbourg had been constructed by the fortress architect [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Sébastien le Préstre de Vauban]] in the seventeenth century. The crossings had been contested before: in 1678 during the French-Dutch war, in [[Siege of Kehl (1703)|1703]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|1733]] during the [[War of the Polish Succession]]. Critical to success of the French plan would be the army's ability  to cross the Rhine at will. Consequently, control of the crossings at [[Hüningen]], near the Swiss city of [[Basle|Basel]], and at Kehl, would give them ready access to most of southwestern Germany; from there, French armies could sweep north, south, or east, depending on their military goal.	|||		|||		|||

Despite a numerical disadvantage, the battle was another victory for the Royalist general [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] over the [[Covenanter]]s, and marked the end of [[William Baillie (soldier)|William Baillie]]'s pursuit of the Royalist forces.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Kulm	|||	Battle of Katzbach	|||	Napoleon's victory in the latter battle coincided with his marshal [[Jacques MacDonald|MacDonald]]'s defeat at [[Battle of Katzbach|Katzbach]], but the Coalition victory in this battle has totally negated his victory, given the fact that his troops never completely crushed the enemy. Thus, by winning this battle, Ostermann-Tolstoy and his troops succeeded in buying much needed time for the Coalition armies to regroup after the [[Battle of Dresden]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Kupres (1992)	|||	Battle of Kupres (1994)	|||	Croatian forces were hampered by an inadequate command structure, poor coordination and lack heavy weapons. The battle resulted in more than 200 killed on both sides, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the plateau was [[Battle of Kupres (1994)|recaptured by the HVO]]. In 2012, [[Republika Srpska]] authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau against civilians and [[prisoners of war]]. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Kusonje	|||	Operation Medak Pocket	|||	During a commemoration service held two years later, a [[landmine]] exploded killing three and wounding others.

Though Napoleon repeatedly engaged some of their units during his [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|counter-offensive campaign]], he was eventually forced from the throne of France after Paris [[Battle of Paris (1814)|fell to the Coalition]] and exiled to the island of [[Elba]]; the First French Empire capitulated for the first time.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Lishi	|||	Second Sino-Japanese War	|||	For the former [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these [[Warlord era|warlords]] and their troops had no problem of following [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves.  These [[Warlord era|warlords]] and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they were well hated by the general population in China, including those [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory.  Therefore, in the impending demilitarisation after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these [[Warlord era|warlord]] would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result.  [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these [[Warlord era|warlords]] and their troops could legitimise themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] regime.	|||	Nationalist strategy	|||		|||

The attack on [[Liège|the city]] began on 5 August 1914 and lasted until 16 August when the last fort surrendered. The length of the siege of Liège may have delayed the German invasion of France by {{nowrap|4–5 days.}} Railways needed by the German armies in eastern [[Belgium]] were closed for the duration of the siege and German troops did not appear in strength before [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]] until 20 August.	|||		|||		|||

After ten days of hard fighting, the US forces took Lone Tree Hill. The Japanese suffered more than 1,000 dead, including some trapped in collapsed caves. The U.S. Army suffered about 700 battle and 500 non-battle casualties. With Lone Tree Hill in American possession, Maffin Bay became a major staging base for six subsequent battles: [[Battle of Biak|Biak]], [[Battle of Noemfoor|Noemfoor]], [[Battle of Sansapor|Sansapor]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] and [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]].	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of Lundy's Lane	|||	Flanders Campaign	|||	Evidence compiled by [[Donald Graves]], a Canadian historian employed at the Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada, argues that General Drummond failed to use skirmish pickets to protect his guns, which were consequently captured by the Americans. Drummond also showed little tactical finesse during his counter-attacks, not using his light infantry to their best advantage and mounting only straightforward frontal attacks. American historian John R. Elting suggests that if Drummond had instead concentrated on the vulnerable American left flank, he might have won a decisive victory.  (Drummond had much administrative experience, but had previously seen action only in the abortive [[Flanders Campaign]] in 1794 as a comparatively junior officer, and in the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian campaign]] in 1801 as commander of a battalion.)	|||	Outcome and analysis	|||		|||

0	Battle of Malakoff	|||	Battle of Inkerman	|||	For months the siege of Sevastopol continued. During July the Russians lost on an average of 250 men a day, and finally the Russians decided to break the stalemate and gradual attrition of their army. Gorchakov and the field army were to make another attack at the Chernaya, the first since the [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]]. On 16 August, both [[Pavel Liprandi]] and Read's corps furiously attacked the 37,000 French and Sardinian troops on the heights above Traktir Bridge. The assailants came on with the greatest determination, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. At the end of the day, the Russians drew off leaving 260 officers and 8,000 men dead or dying on the field; the French and British only lost 1,700. With this defeat the last chance of saving Sevastopol vanished.	|||	Battle	|||		|||
0	Battle of Mariazell	|||	Battle of Amstetten	|||	The 1805 war began with the [[Ulm Campaign]] which was disastrous for Austria, with only the corps of [[Michael von Kienmayer]] and [[Franz Jellacic]] escaping envelopment by the [[Grande Armée]] of [[Napoleon]]. As Kienmayer's columns fled to the east, they joined with elements of the [[Russian Empire]]'s army in a [[rear guard]] action at the [[Battle of Amstetten]] on 5 November. A few days later, Davout's III Corps caught up with Merveldt's division at Mariazell. The Austrian soldiers, their morale shaken by continuous retreating, were routed after a brief struggle. On 12 November, Austria's capital [[Vienna]] fell to the French without a fight. The outcome of the war would be decided by the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in early December.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of Overloon	|||	Battle for Caen	|||	The battle of Overloon has become known as the second [[Battle for Caen|battle of Caen]] due to its ferocity and also as the forgotten battle, because like the other engagements in the Peel area it is not well known in much of the Netherlands.	|||	Remembrance	|||		|||
0	Battle of Passchendaele	|||	Battle of Messines (1917)	|||	The choice of Flanders over areas further south or the Italian front, the climate and weather in Flanders, the choice of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Hubert Gough]] and the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] to conduct the offensive, debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives, have also been controversial. The passage of time between the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] {{nowrap|(7–14 June)}} and the opening attack of the Battles of Ypres, the extent to which the internal troubles of the French armies motivated British persistence with the offensive, the effect of the weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human cost of the campaign on the soldiers of the German and British armies, have also been argued over ever since.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Passchendaele	|||	Battle of the Lys (1918)	|||	Further operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuwpoort, combined with [[Operation Hush]] (an amphibious landing), were to have reached [[Bruges]] and then the Dutch frontier. The resistance of the [[4th Army (German Empire)|German 4th Army]], unusually wet weather, the onset of winter and the diversion of British and French resources to [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]], following the Austro-German victory at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] {{nowrap|(24 October – 19 November),}} enabled the Germans to avoid a general withdrawal, which had seemed inevitable in early October. The campaign ended in November, when the [[Canadian Corps]] captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and the new year. In 1918, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] and the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.	|||		|||		|||

Pent-up dissatisfaction with Buell's performance resulted in a reorganization of the Western departments. On October 24, a new Department of the Cumberland was formed under Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]], and Buell's Army of the Ohio was assigned to it, redesignated the [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. (After the [[Battle of Stones River]] at Murfreesboro in late December, another strategic defeat for Braxton Bragg, it would receive its more familiar name, the [[Army of the Cumberland]].) Buell was ordered to appear before a commission investigating his conduct during the campaign. He remained in military limbo for a year and a half, his career essentially ruined.

Spain viewed either the capture of Turin and Milan desirable, but, since France wished to negotiate with Charles Emmanuel, this left Spain only with Milan. Therefore, on 28 November 1745 De Gages began the Spanish invasion of Lombardy. It was not long before the Austrian commander [[Josef Wenzel, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Josef Wenzel]] of Liechtenstein retired his army prior to the Spanish advance out of fears his undermanned army would be destroyed. Milan surrendered peacefully, and by the end of the year most of [[Lombardy]] was in Spanish hands.	|||	The Bourbon position	|||		|||

Although he held the rank of Major General in the New York state militia, Van Rensselaer had not commanded troops in battle and was not a warrior, being considered the leading [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] candidate for the [[Governor of New York|governorship of New York]]. Possibly hoping to get Van Rensselaer out of the way, New York Governor [[Daniel Tompkins]] had put Van Rensselaer's name forward to command the army on the Niagara, and he officially took command on 13 July. Van Rensselaer secured the appointment of his second cousin, Colonel [[Solomon Van Rensselaer]], as his [[aide-de-camp]]. Solomon van Rensselaer was an experienced soldier (who had been wounded at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794), and a valuable source of advice to the General.	|||	Background	|||		|||

For the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] – Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] armies of King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1705. Although the Allies had [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|captured Barcelona]] that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], had stalled in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV was desirous of peace – but he wanted it on reasonable terms.

It was fought between an English [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] army under [[Michael Jones (soldier)|Michael Jones]] which held Dublin and an army composed of [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate]] and English [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops under the command of the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Earl of Ormonde]].

During this time, most of Ireland was ruled by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]], a government of Irish Catholics based in [[Kilkenny]]. The Confederates allied themselves with the English Royalists in the [[English Civil War]], against the English Parliament, which was committed to re-conquering Ireland, suppressing the Catholic religion and destroying the Irish Catholic land-owning class. After much internal in-fighting, the Confederates signed a peace treaty with [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who was soon to be executed by the [[Rump Parliament]], agreeing to accept English Royalist troops into Ireland and put their own armies under the command of Royalist officers, in particular [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]].

Chinese forces fell back in disarray to the Great Wall, where after a [[Defense of the Great Wall|series of battles and skirmishes]], the Japanese Army seized a number of strategic points, and then agreed to a [[cease fire]] and a negotiated settlement (the [[Tangku Truce]]) whereby a [[demilitarized zone]] would be established between the Great Wall and [[Beijing]]. However, this would prove to be only a temporary respite before the full scale combat of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] erupted in earnest in 1937.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Rio de Janeiro	|||	Battle of Malplaquet	|||	There were multiple reasons for the French to plan an attack on Rio de Janeiro.  Firstly, the commander Duguay-Trouin had a personal reason: he was almost bankrupt.  The second reason was political. The war had not gone well for France. After the defeat in the [[Battle of Malplaquet]], the enemy was on French soil and French morale was low. A military success was urgently needed.  The third reason was a question of honour. The previous year another [[buccaneer]], [[Jean-François Duclerc]] had attempted [[Battle of Rio de Janeiro (1710)|an attack on Rio]], but this expedition had ended in disaster; Duclerc and 600 of his soldiers were captured and held in unacceptable conditions. The Portuguese refused to exchange these prisoners as was stipulated in a Franco-Portuguese treaty from 1707; furthermore, Duclerc was killed in prison under mysterious circumstances in May 1711.  The French wanted to liberate these prisoners, and possibly conquer some Brazilian territory.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Saint-Mihiel	|||	Battle of Cambrai (1917)	|||	Although the AEF was new to the French theater of war, they trained hard for several months in preparation for fighting against the German armies. The use by the British of tanks at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in 1917  impressed General Pershing so much that he ordered the creation of a tank force to support the AEF's infantry. As a result, by September 1918, Colonel [[George S.

By dawn on 25 September, when a regiment and two squadrons of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade attacked Samakh, the rearguard was strongly entrenched. The assault, which began with a mounted cavalry charge, ended two hours later after close quarter fighting in the village and the railway station. After fierce fighting with [[bayonet]]s and [[sword]]s, from room to room in the railway buildings, the town was captured. This victory, which captured the centre of the rearguard line, concluded the Battle of Sharon section of the Battle of Megiddo and opened the way for the cavalry pursuit [[Capture of Damascus (1918)|to Damascus]], which was captured on 1 October. By the time the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was signed at the end of October, [[Battle of Aleppo (1918)|Aleppo]] had been captured and fighting was in progress further north.	|||		|||		|||

Even so, most of the original Neapolitan force had been killed, wounded or deserted, and Murat's force only totalled 15,000. Meanwhile, General Nugent's force, who had marched from [[Florence]], arrived in [[Rome]] on 30 April.

This move threw the Armenian leadership in the [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]] into a panic, since it  removed from the region the only force capable of protecting the Armenian people from the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had effectively [[Armenian Genocide|exterminated its Armenian population]] through systematic massacres and deportations.

0	Battle of Scarrifholis	|||	Irish Rebellion of 1641	|||	The Ulster Army was raised by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] in 1642 to organise the insurgent forces who were operating there since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|rebellion]] of the previous year. Up to 1649, it was commanded by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]], a professional soldier who had served in the Spanish army in Flanders. However, O'Neill died in late 1649 and was replaced by Bishop Heber MacMahon of Clogher. MacMahon had no real military experience, but was elected by the Ulster officers to avoid political infighting among their officers. The army was split between those who supported the Confederate's treaty with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], mainly pre-war land-owners such as [[Felim O'Neill of Kinard|Phelim O'Neill]] and the army's professional officers and Catholic clergy who did not support a deal with the Royalists that did not guarantee the public exercise of the Catholic religion and return confiscated lands to Catholic landowners. In 1648, Owen Roe O'Neill had left the Confederation and briefly fought with the other Confederate armies over the treaty with the Royalists. He even negotiated with the English Parliamentarian forces in Ulster to try to secure a better deal for Catholic interests. He only re-joined the Catholic Confederation after the invasion of Ireland by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in August 1649, when it was clear that the English Parliament was the most dangerous enemy faced by Irish Catholics.	|||	Background	|||		|||

0	Battle of Sharon	|||	Capture of Damascus (1918)	|||	The cavalry phase of the Battle of Sharon began as soon as the gap was made during the infantry attacks. The [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Division]] led the way north up along the [[Plain of Sharon]] followed by the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]] with the [[Australian Mounted Division]] in reserve. These divisions subsequently rode across the [[Mount Carmel Range]] through two passes, to occupy the Esdraelon Plain, on 20 September. Here they cut the main Ottoman lines of communication. Units of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions converged to capture [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah]] with the 4th Cavalry Division capturing Beisan in the afternoon. The Australian Mounted Division [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|captured Jenin]] along with thousands of prisoners when they captured the main line of retreat from Nablus to Damascus. On 20 September [[Nazareth]], the site of the Ottoman Army's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, was unsuccessfully attacked by the 5th Cavalry Division. During the [[Battle of Nazareth]] the Ottoman Commander in Chief, [[Otto Liman von Sanders]], was forced to escape. The 5th Cavalry Division captured the town the following day and several days later this division also captured Haifa and Acre following the [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Battle of Haifa]]. On the last day of the Battle of Sharon, the Australian Mounted Division attacked a German reinforced rearguard garrison at [[Samakh, Tiberias|Samakh]], which had been put on the alert by Liman von Sanders during his escape from Nazareth. The Australian Light Horse victory at the [[Battle of Samakh]] and the subsequent [[Capture of Tiberias]] ended the Battle of Sharon and the Battle of Megiddo. As a result of the battles of Sharon and Nablus, known collectively as the Battle of Megiddo, much territory and many prisoners were captured. The Final Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign began the day after the Battle of Megiddo ended, with the [[Capture of Damascus (1918)|pursuit to Damascus]], which was captured on 1 October.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of Shiloh	|||	Siege of Corinth	|||	Nevertheless, Grant's career suffered temporarily in the aftermath of Shiloh. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced slowly toward Corinth and [[Siege of Corinth|captured it]], while an amphibious force on the [[Mississippi River]] destroyed the Confederates' [[River Defense Fleet]] and captured [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies. With Halleck's departure to the East, Grant was restored to command and eventually pushed down the Mississippi River to besiege [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]], Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two. Command of the Army of Mississippi fell to Braxton Bragg, who was promoted to full general on April 6, and during the fall of 1862, he led it on an unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky, culminating in his retreat from the [[Battle of Perryville]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

That battle would mark Russian victory in Lithuania. Shklov was taken by the Russians in September 1654. The besieged Polish–Lithuanian garrison of [[Smolensk]] found itself in an isolated situation and lost its hopes to hold out until reinforcements could arrive. This forced the garrison to surrender (see [[Siege of Smolensk (1654)]]).

It was the last major battle in world history where all the armies were under the personal command of their monarchs. Perhaps 300,000 soldiers fought in this important battle, the largest since the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813. There were about 130,000 Austrian troops and a combined total of 140,000 French and allied Piedmontese troops.

The [[Battle of Hartsville]], at a crossing point on the [[Cumberland River]] about 40 miles (64 km) upstream from Nashville (north of Murfreesboro) was an incident in Morgan's raid to the north, before Rosecrans had the bulk of his infantry forces on the move. The relatively small battle that followed Morgan's surprise attack was an embarrassing Union defeat, resulting in many captured Union supplies and soldiers. The Union also engaged in a strategic cavalry raid. On December 26, the day Rosecrans marched from Nashville, a small force under Brig. Gen. [[Samuel P. Carter]] raided the upper Tennessee Valley from [[Manchester, Kentucky]]. Until January 5, Carter's men destroyed railroad bridges and fought a few skirmishes, including a serious one on December 28 at Perkins's Mill (also known as Elk Fort). But none of the cavalry raids, Confederate or Union, had any significant effect on the Stones River Campaign.	|||	Background and initial movements	|||		|||

0	Battle of Towton	|||	Battle of Wakefield	|||	Contemporary accounts described Henry VI as peaceful and pious, not suited for the violent dynastic civil wars, such as the War of the Roses.  He had periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall.  His ineffectual rule had encouraged the nobles' schemes to establish control over him, and the situation deteriorated into a civil war between the supporters of his house and those of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]].  After the Yorkists captured Henry in 1460, the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] passed an [[Act of Accord]] to let York and his line succeed Henry as king. Henry's consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], refused to accept the dispossession of her son's right to the throne and, along with fellow Lancastrian malcontents, raised an army. Richard of York was killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and his titles, including the claim to the throne, passed to his eldest son Edward. Nobles who were previously hesitant to support Richard's claim to the throne considered the Lancastrians to have reneged on the Act — a legal agreement — and Edward found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king. The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor's right to rule over England through force of arms.	|||		|||		|||

The city was renamed in 1961 to [[Volgograd]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of Verdun	|||	Second Battle of Champagne	|||	The German strategy assumed that the French would attempt to hold on to the east bank of the Meuse, then commit the French strategic reserve to recapture it and suffer catastrophic losses from German artillery-fire, while the German infantry held positions easy to defend and suffered fewer losses. The German plan was based on the experience of the [[Second Battle of Champagne|battles in Champagne]] ({{lang|de|''Herbstschlacht''}} September–October 1915) when after early success, the French offensive was defeated with far more French than German casualties. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the German offensive ({{lang|de|''Unternehmen Gericht''}}/Operation Judgement) until 21 February; French construction of defensive lines and the arrival of reinforcements before the opening attack, delayed the German advance despite many losses. By 6 March, {{frac|20|1|2}} French divisions were in the RFV and a defence in depth had been established. Pétain ordered that [[On ne passe pas|no withdrawals]] were to be made and that counter-attacks were to be conducted, despite exposing French infantry to fire from the German artillery. By 29 March, French artillery on the west bank had begun a constant bombardment of German positions on the east bank, which caused many German infantry casualties.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of the Atlantic	|||	Convoy SC 7	|||	Pack tactics were first used successfully in September and October 1940, to devastating effect, in a series of convoy battles. On September 21, convoy [[Convoy HX 72|HX 72]] of 42 merchantmen was attacked by a pack of four U-boats, losing eleven ships sunk and two damaged over two nights. In October, the slow convoy [[Convoy SC 7|SC 7]], with an escort of two sloops and two corvettes, was overwhelmed, losing 59% of its ships. The battle for [[Convoy HX 79|HX 79]] in the following days was in many ways worse for the escorts than for SC 7. The loss of a quarter of the convoy without any loss to the U-boats, despite very strong escort (two destroyers, four corvettes, three trawlers, and a minesweeper) demonstrated the effectiveness of the German tactics against the inadequate British anti-submarine methods. On December 1, seven German and three Italian submarines caught [[convoy HX 90|HX 90]], sinking 10 ships and damaging three others. The success of pack tactics against these convoys encouraged Admiral Dönitz to adopt the wolf pack as his primary tactic.	|||	British situation	|||	'The Happy Time' (June 1940 – February 1941)	|||
0	Battle of the Boyne	|||	Irish Confederate Wars	|||	In an Irish context, the war was a [[sectarian]] and [[ethnic]] conflict, in many ways a re-run of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] of 50 years earlier. For the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the war was fought for Irish sovereignty, religious tolerance for Catholicism, and land ownership. The Catholic upper classes had lost almost all their lands after [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwell's conquest]], as well as the right to hold public office, practice their religion, and sit in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. They saw the Catholic King James as a means of redressing these grievances and securing the autonomy of Ireland from England. To these ends, under [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel]], they had raised an army to restore James after the Glorious Revolution. By 1690, they controlled all of Ireland except for the province of [[Ulster]]. Most of James II's troops at the Boyne were Irish Catholics.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of the Boyne	|||	Irish Rebellion of 1641	|||	Conversely, for the Williamites, the war was about maintaining Protestant and English rule in Ireland. They feared for their lives and their property if James and his Catholic supporters were to rule Ireland, nor did they trust the promise of tolerance, seeing the Declaration of Indulgence as a ploy to re-establish Catholicism as the sole [[state religion]]. In particular, they dreaded a repeat of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], which had been marked by widespread killing. For these reasons, Protestants fought en masse for William of Orange. Many Williamite troops at the Boyne, including their very effective irregular cavalry, were [[Ulster Protestants]], who called themselves 'Inniskillingers' and were referred to by contemporaries as '[[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]]'.	|||	Background	|||		|||

0	Battle of the Coral Sea	|||	Guadalcanal Campaign	|||	Although a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, the battle would prove to be a strategic victory for the Allies for several reasons. The battle marked the first time since the start of the war that a major Japanese advance had been checked by the Allies. More importantly, the Japanese fleet carriers ''Shōkaku'' and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} – one damaged and the other with a depleted aircraft complement – were unable to participate in the [[Battle of Midway]], which took place the following month, ensuring a rough parity in aircraft between the two adversaries and contributing significantly to the US victory in that battle. The severe losses in carriers at Midway prevented the Japanese from reattempting to invade Port Moresby from the ocean. Two months later, the Allies took advantage of Japan's resulting strategic vulnerability in the South Pacific and launched the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] that, along with the [[New Guinea Campaign]], eventually broke Japanese defenses in the South Pacific and was a significant contributing factor to Japan's ultimate defeat in World War II.	|||		|||		|||

Part of the wider [[Bougainville Campaign]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]], the battle was fought in the southern sector of [[Bougainville Island]] and occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945, as elements of the Australian [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]] advanced along the Buin Road towards the [[Hongorai River]] and then forced their way across it. Following the end of the initial fighting, the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]] continued until torrential rain and flooding brought it to a halt, washing away many bridges and roads upon which they relied for supplies. With hostilities coming to a close the Japanese began harassing the Australian [[line of communication]]s, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late-July and into August, preparations to resume the advance continued. Ultimately, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began.	|||		|||		|||

Over a thousand Americans died, comparable to the combined losses of American men and ships at the better known Battles of the [[Battle of Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]]. But in exchange for the heavy losses for such a small force, they sank or disabled three Japanese cruisers and caused enough confusion to persuade the Japanese commander, Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]], to regroup and ultimately withdraw, rather than advancing to sink troop and supply ships at [[Leyte Gulf]]. In the combined Battle of Leyte Gulf, 10,000 Japanese sailors and 3,000 Americans died. Although the battleship ''Yamato'' and the remaining force returned to Japan, the battles marked the final defeat of the Japanese Navy, as the ships remained in port for most of the rest of the war and ceased to be an effective naval force.	|||		|||		|||

Despite the Prime Minister's desire to have 5,000 airborne troops within a short period, a number of problems were rapidly encountered by the War Office. Very few [[military glider]]s existed in Britain in 1940, and these were too light for military purposes, and there was also a shortage of suitable transport aircraft to tow gliders and carry paratroopers.

0	Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Northeast China	|||	Second Sino-Japanese War	|||	The third grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist regime was similar to the second one, but this one was about its own troops left behind during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].  The resource strained nationalist government could not provide enough supports to these troops left behind the enemy lines, who were forced to turn to banditry for survival when they were left on their own, and this had alienated many of the troops left behind, and it was impossible to expect them to fight their communist enemy with the same kind of dedication like those nationalist agents who believed in their political cause, or the American trained new forces.  The banditry also alienated the local populace and caused the nationalists to lose popular support.  Compounding the problem, due to the need of bandits' knowledge of local area, and the fact that they were the only pro-nationalist force in the region, they were often rewarded with higher ranks than the highly trained regular nationalist troops sent to [[Northeast China]].  As a result, the regular nationalist troops sent to Northeast China after [[World War II]] lacked any willingness to work together with the bandits, especially when many of the bandits were former [[Warlord era|warlords]]'s troops cooperated with Japanese invaders.  Many loyal nationalists were enraged by the fact that they had to serve under the former-enemy they once fought: in all, Chiang's government awarded bandits with many high military ranks: 32 commander-in-chiefs, 33 army commanders, and 158 division commanders in all.  In contrast, the highly trained regular nationalist army sent to [[Northeast China]] after [[World War II]] had much fewer similar ranks, meaning that most highly qualified professional officers ranked below bandits.  Meanwhile, the bandits lacked the similar willingness and attempted to expend those nationalist troops whenever they could to save their own skin, and often used the superior ranks Chiang's government given to them as their excuses to ignore correct strategies ordered by the nationalist regular army.	|||	Nationalists' strategy	|||		|||

The Ulster Army met a Parliamentarian army, composed mainly of British settlers and commanded by Charles Coote, at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]] in [[County Donegal]] in June 1650. The Ulster army was routed and as many as 2,000 of its men were killed.  In addition, MacMahon and most of the Ulster Army's officers were either killed at the battle or captured and executed after it. This eliminated the last strong field army opposing the Parliamentarians in Ireland and secured for them the northern province of Ulster.

0	French Revolution	|||	Battle of the Nile	|||	The Army at first was quite successful. It conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands and made it a puppet state. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, retaking Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands and ending the flow of payments from the conquered areas to France. The treasury was empty. Despite his publicity claiming many glorious victories, Napoleon's army was trapped in Egypt after the British sank the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]]. Napoleon escaped by himself, returned to Paris and overthrew the Directory in November, 1799.	|||	First Republic	|||	The Directory (1795–1799)	|||	Exporting the Revolution

The Nationalists soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted a revolution and did everything to prevent it, as 'November Criminals' (''Novemberverbrecher''). The radical right did not even stop at political assassinations, e.g., [[Matthias Erzberger]] and [[Walter Rathenau]]. In [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Beer Hall Putsch|attempted coup in 1923]] together with Ludendorff, they deliberately chose the heavily symbolic date of 9 November. In his later ascent to power, Hitler, who had served in the Imperial German Army as a corporal, cunningly exploited the sentiments of the homecomers who felt betrayed not only by the new democratic government but also by their commanders who had sent them to useless slaughter, especially in the [[Battle of Verdun]].	|||	 Background 	|||	 Request for cease fire and change of constitution 	|||

The Belgian army fought a defensive [[Battle of the Yser|battle on the Yser]] (16–31 October) from [[Nieuport]] south to [[Dixmude]], as the 4th Army attacked westwards and French, British and some Belgian troops fought the First Battle of Ypres (19 October – 22 November) against the 4th and 6th armies. By November 1914, most of Belgium was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|under German occupation]] and Allied blockade. A military administration {{lang|de|''Kaiserliches Deutsches Generalgouvernement Belgien''}} was established on 26 August 1914, to rule Belgium through the pre-war Belgian administrative system, overseen by a small group of German officers and officials. Belgium was divided into three administrative zones: the [[General Governorate of Belgium|General Governorate]], which included Brussels and the hinterland; a second zone, under the 4th Army, including [[Ghent]] and Antwerp; and a third zone under the German Navy along the coastline. The German occupation was maintained until late 1918.	|||		|||		|||

0	Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)	|||	Battle of Midway	|||	After striking Tulagi, ''Yorktown'' rejoined with ''Lexington'', and the two carriers engaged the rest of the Japanese forces involved in the ''Mo'' operation from 6–8 May in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]]. In the battle, ''Lexington'' was sunk and ''Yorktown'' was damaged. The Japanese suffered ''Shōhō'' sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the [[Battle of Midway]]. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an [[Kokoda Track campaign|ultimately unsuccessful overland attack]] along the [[Kokoda Track]]. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)	|||	New Guinea campaign	|||	Over the next several months, the Japanese established a naval refueling, communications, and [[seaplane]] reconnaissance base on Tulagi and the nearby [[islets]] of [[Gavutu]] and [[Tanambogo]], and in July 1942 began to build a large airfield on nearby [[Guadalcanal]]. The Japanese activities on Tulagi and Guadalcanal were observed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]], as well as by Australian [[coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] personnel stationed in the area. Because these activities threatened the Allied supply and communication lines in the South Pacific, Allied forces counter-attacked with landings of their own on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942, initiating the critical [[Guadalcanal campaign]] and a series of combined arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces that, along with the [[New Guinea campaign]], decided the course of the war in the South Pacific.	|||		|||		|||

The rebellion spread throughout the country and at [[Kilkenny]] in 1642 the Association of The [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics of Ireland]] was formed to organise the Catholic war effort. The Confederation was essentially an independent state and was a coalition of all shades of Irish Catholic society, both [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]. The Irish Confederates professed to side with the English [[Cavalier]]s during the ensuing civil wars, but mostly fought their own war in defence of the Catholic landed class' interests.	|||	Overview	|||		|||

Rinuccini, the Papal Nuncio, threatened to [[excommunicate]] anyone who accepted the deal.

There was even a brief period of civil war in 1648 between [[Owen Roe O'Neill]]'s Ulster Army, as he refused to accept the Royalist alliance, and the new Royalist–Confederate coalition. O'Neill neglected to secure adequate supplies and was unable to force a change in policy on his former comrades. During this divisive period the Confederates missed a second strategic chance to reorganise while their opponents were engaged in the [[Second English Civil War]] (1648–49), which was lost by their royalist allies.	|||	{{anchor|Confederates}}The Confederates' war, 1642–48	|||	Victory and defeat for the Confederates	|||

In turn, the rebels' suspected association with Charles helped start the [[English Civil War]]. The English and Scottish Parliaments refused to raise an army to put down the rebellion unless it was under their command rather than the King's.	|||		|||		|||
0	Irish War of Independence	|||	Spring Offensive	|||	In April 1918, the British Cabinet, in the face of the crisis caused by the German [[Spring Offensive]], attempted with a dual policy to simultaneously link the enactment of [[conscription]] into Ireland with the implementation of Home Rule, as outlined in the report of the [[Irish Convention#Europe intervenes|Irish Convention]] of 8 April 1918. This further alienated Irish nationalists and produced mass demonstrations during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. In the [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|1918 general election]] Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy by giving Sinn Féin 70% (73 seats out of 105,) of Irish seats, 25 of these uncontested. Sinn Féin won 91% of the seats outside of [[Ulster]] on 46.9% of votes cast, but was in a minority in Ulster, where unionists were in a majority. Sinn Féin pledged not to sit in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], but rather to set up an Irish Parliament. This parliament, known as the [[First Dáil]], and its ministry, called the [[Aireacht]], consisting only of Sinn Féin members, met at the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] on 21 January 1919. The Dáil reaffirmed the 1916 Proclamation with the Declaration of Independence, and issued a [[Message to the Free Nations of the World]], which stated that there was an 'existing state of war, between Ireland and England'. The Irish Volunteers were reconstituted as the '[[Irish Republican Army]]' or IRA.

In order to deceive the American [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], a diversionary attack was ordered to take place in the Aleutians, thus beginning the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. During the [[Battle of Midway]], Japanese forces were repulsed in a decisive action, meanwhile on 6 June, Japanese naval forces under [[Boshirō Hosogaya]] landed troops unopposed at Kiska and Attu islands. A force consisting of 1,140 [[infantry]] under [[Major]] [[Matsutoshi Hosumi]] took control of the island and captured forty-five [[Aleut people|Aleut]] civilians and a school teacher.

Paris was considered to have too great a value, culturally and historically, to risk its destruction. General Eisenhower was keen to avoid a drawn-out battle of attrition, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] or the [[Battle of Leningrad]]. It was also estimated that, in the event of a siege, {{convert|4000|ST|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of food per day, as well as significant amounts of building materials, manpower, and engineering skill, would be required to feed the population after the liberation of Paris.

The [[Occupation of Baltic states|Soviets invaded and occupied]] Lithuania by the end of 1944. As forced [[conscription]] into Red Army and [[Stalinist]] repressions intensified, thousands of Lithuanians used forests in the countryside as a natural refuge. These spontaneous groups became more organized and centralized culminating in the establishment of the [[Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters]] in February 1948. In their documents, the partisans emphasized that their ultimate goal is recreation of independent Lithuania. As the partisan war continued, it became clear that the West would not interfere in Eastern Europe (see [[Western betrayal]]) and that the partisans had no chance of success against the far stronger opponent. Eventually, the partisans made an explicit and conscious decision not to accept any new members. The leadership of the partisans was destroyed in 1953 thus effectively ending the partisan war, though individual fighters held out until the 1960s.	|||		|||		|||

The [[National Islamic Front]] government agreed to the entry of the Ugandan military into its borders, albeit below the so-called 'red line' consisting of the [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]]-[[Torit]] highway.  This was part of its efforts to broadcast its new status as an engaged member of the international community.  This agreement, coupled with the return of Ugandan forces that had been deployed in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] upon the official end of the [[Second Congo War]], created what the Ugandan government felt was an ideal situation in which to end a conflict that had become both an embarrassment and political liability.	|||	 Operation Iron Fist 	|||		|||

As the first ceremony of such magnitude ever initiated and dominated by African Americans, the march also was the first to have its nature wholly misperceived in advance.  Dominant expectations ran from paternal apprehension to dread. On [[Meet the Press]], reporters grilled Roy Wilkins and Martin Luther King about widespread foreboding that 'it would be impossible to bring more than 100,000 militant Negroes into Washington without incidents and possibly rioting.' [[Life magazine]] declared that the capital was suffering 'its worst case of invasion jitters since the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].'  The Pentagon readied 19,000 troops in the suburbs and the jails shifted inmates to other prisons to make room for those arrested in [[mass arrest]]s; the city banned all sales of alcoholic beverages; hospitals made room for riot casualties by postponing elective surgery.   With nearly 1,700 extra correspondents supplementing the Washington press corps, the march drew a media assembly larger than the Kennedy inauguration two years earlier.

In early November 1941, the feature was held by German infantry of the ''Division z.b.V. Afrika'' (later named the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light ''Afrika'' Division]]). The New Zealanders and [[Infantry tanks]] of the [[1st Army Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Army Tank Brigade]] attacked and captured Point 175 on 23 November, during the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, which was part of [[Operation Crusader]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The New Zealand troops then attacked westwards and made contact with the Tobruk garrison, which had broken out to meet them. From 29 November – 1 December, the New Zealanders defended the point and the area to the west against Axis counter-attacks, intended to sever the link with the Tobruk garrison and regain control of the roads in the area.

When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for 'a third Russian revolution,' a movement that received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the [[Tambov rebellion]], 1919–1921, and the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] in March 1921.

0	Second Anglo-Dutch War	|||	War of Devolution	|||	Early 1667, the financial position of the English crown became desperate. The kingdom simply lacked the money to make the entire fleet seaworthy, so it was decided in February that the heavy ships would remain laid up at [[Chatham, England|Chatham]]. Clarendon explained to Charles that he had but two options: either to make very substantial concessions to Parliament or to begin peace talks with the Dutch under their conditions. In March these were indeed started at [[Breda]], in the southern [[Generality Lands]], as negotiations in the provinces themselves would by the conventions of the day be considered a sign of inferiority for the Dutch.  Charles, however, did not negotiate in good faith. He had already decided to turn to a third option: becoming a secret ally of France to obtain money and undermine the Dutch position. {{rp |76}}  On 18 April he concluded his first secret treaty with Louis, stipulating that England would support a French conquest of the Spanish Netherlands. In May the French invaded, starting the [[War of Devolution]]; Charles hoped, by procrastinating the talks at Breda, to gain enough time to ready his fleet in order to obtain concessions from the Dutch, using the French advance as leverage.	|||	The War	|||	1667: Medway	|||

The initial French attack broke through and captured Vimy Ridge but reserve units were not able to reinforce the troops on the ridge, before German counter-attacks forced them back about half-way to their jumping-off points. The British attack at Aubers Ridge was a costly failure and two German divisions in reserve were diverted south against the Tenth Army.

0	Second Battle of El Alamein	|||	Operation Torch	|||	The '''Second Battle of El Alamein''' (23 October – 11 November 1942) took place near the [[Egypt]]ian railway halt of [[El Alamein]]. With the Allies victorious, it marked a major turning point in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of the Second World War. It followed the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], which had stalled the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] advance into Egypt, after which, in August 1942, [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] had taken command of the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] from General [[Claude Auchinleck]]. This victory turned the tide in the [[North African Campaign]] and ended the Axis threat to [[Egypt]], the [[Suez Canal]], and of gaining access to the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields via North Africa. From a psychological perspective, Second El Alamein revived the morale of the Allies, being the first major offensive against the Axis since the start of the European war in 1939 in which the Western Allies had achieved a decisive victory. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]], which started 8 November.	|||		|||		|||
0	Second Battle of Kehl (1796)	|||	Siege of Kehl (1703)	|||	In the 1790s, the Rhine was wild, unpredictable, and difficult to cross. Its channels and tributaries created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons. A complex of bridges, gates, fortifications and [[Barrage (dam)|barrage dam]]s linked Kehl with Strasbourg. These had been constructed by the fortress architect [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Sébastien le Préstre de Vauban]] in the seventeenth century. The crossings had been contested before: in 1678 during the French-Dutch war, in [[Siege of Kehl (1703)|1703]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], in [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|1733]] during the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and earlier in [[Battle of Kehl (1796)|Battle of Kehl]], when the French crossed into the German states on 23-24 June. Critical to French success would be the army's ability to cross the Rhine at will.  The crossings at [[Hüningen]], near the Swiss city of [[Basle|Basel]], and at Kehl, offered access to most of southwestern Germany; from there, French armies could sweep north, south, or east, depending on their military goal.	|||		|||		|||

Both the communists and the nationalists believed that World War III was a real possibility and this perception influenced the strategic decisions of both sides.  The nationalists who defended the city, had hoped that by using the resources of the wealthiest city of China, they would last until World War III when foreign intervention would occur. With foreign intervention, not only they would be able to defend the city, but they could counterattack and take China back from the enemy.  If the city could not last until World War III, the nationalist would withdraw via sea and transfer the wealth with them, after destroying the city completely, just like the scorched-earth policy used against the Japanese invaders in many part of the China during [[World War II]].  Although the truthfulness of this perception of the nationalists remained in question, the enemy certainly believed that there was a possibility, as the nationalist propaganda had claimed, and thus was determined not to let it happen by taking the city as early as possible.	|||	 Prelude 	|||		|||
0	Sherman's March to the Sea	|||	Battle of Waynesboro, Georgia	|||	Several small actions followed. Wheeler and some infantry struck in a rearguard action at Ball's Ferry on November 24 and November 25. While Howard's wing was delayed near Ball's Bluff, the 1st Alabama Cavalry (a Federal regiment) engaged Confederate pickets. Overnight, Union engineers constructed a bridge {{convert|2|mi|km}} away from the bluff across the [[Oconee River]], and 200 soldiers crossed to [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] the Confederate position. On November 25–26 at Sandersville, Wheeler struck at Slocum's advance guard. Kilpatrick was ordered to make a feint toward Augusta before destroying the railroad bridge at Brier Creek and moving to liberate the Camp Lawton [[prisoner of war camp]] at [[Millen, Georgia|Millen]]. Kilpatrick slipped by the defensive line that Wheeler had placed near Brier Creek, but on the night of November 26 Wheeler attacked and drove the 8th Indiana and 2nd Kentucky Cavalry away from their camps at Sylvan Grove. Kilpatrick abandoned his plans to destroy the railroad bridge and he also learned that the prisoners had been moved from Camp Lawton, so he rejoined the army at [[Louisville, Georgia|Louisville]]. At the [[Battle of Buck Head Creek]] on November 28, Kilpatrick was surprised and nearly captured, but the [[5th Ohio Cavalry]] halted Wheeler's advance, and Wheeler was later stopped decisively by Union barricades at Reynolds's Plantation.

The [[Battle of Ascalon]] was fought outside the city in 1099 in the aftermath of the [[First Crusade]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|fall of Jerusalem]] to the Crusaders. Although the crusaders were victorious, internal disputes in their camp allowed Ascalon to remain in Egyptian hands. Thereafter, the Fatimids were able to launch raids into the kingdom every year from this fortress, and the southern border of the crusader kingdom remained unstable. If this fortress fell, then the gateway to Egypt would be open. Therefore, the Fatimid garrison in Ascalon remained strong and large.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||
0	Siege of Belgrade (1717)	|||	Siege of Belgrade (1688)	|||	After the success of his 1716 campaign, Eugene of Savoy had one main objective: the conquest of the fortress of [[Belgrade]]. The city is located exactly at the confluence of the [[Sava]] river and the [[Danube]]. The fortress, located on an arm of the Sava, can be attacked from the south. The strategic value of this position lies in its walls which can resist both attacks from the south-east and those from the north-west and this makes it a key to the [[Balkan]]s for both the Austrians and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1688, Belgrade was wrested from the Ottomans after a [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|siege]], but two years later, the [[Ottoman Empire]] recaptured it. Prince Eugene was seriously wounded during the first siege and now strongly supported the need for a river flotilla on the Danube as being essential for the conquest of Belgrade.   The mission of the fleet was to provide assistance and support to the imperial army. Eugene managed to enlist the Emperor's support, and the crew for the ships was hastily recruited in the Netherlands.	|||	 Prologue 	|||		|||

Made cautious by the staggering losses at Shiloh, Halleck embarked on a tedious campaign of offensive entrenchment, fortifying after each advance. By May 25, 1862, after moving five miles in three weeks, Halleck was in position to lay siege to the town.  Confederate morale was low and Beauregard was outnumbered two to one. The water was bad. Typhoid and dysentery had felled thousands of his men. At a council of war, the Confederate officers concluded that they could not hold the railroad crossover. Sickness had claimed the lives of almost as many men as the Confederacy had lost at Shiloh.	|||	Background	|||		|||

0	Siege of Godesberg	|||	Cuius regio, eius religio	|||	At its most fundamental, it was a local feud between two competing dynastic interests—the [[Seneschal]]s (''Truchsess'') of the [[House of Waldburg]] and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach—that acquired religious overtones. The dispute had broad implications in the political, social, and dynastic balance of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It tested the principle of [[ecclesiastical reservation]] established in the religious [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with the principle ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'': the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign. Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots or abbesses) from ''cuius regio, eius religio''. In an ecclesiastical territory, if the prelate changed his religion, his subjects did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post. Problematically, the 1555 agreement did not specify this detail.	|||	Background	|||		|||

The defeat of Jourdan's army at [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]], [[Battle of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[Battle of Altenkirchen|Altenkirchen]] allowed Charles to move more troops to the south. The next contact occurred on 19 October at [[Battle of Emmendingen|Emmendingen]], in the [[Elz (Rhine)|Elz]] valley which winds through the Black Forest. The section of the valley involved  in the battle runs southwest through the mountains from Elzach, through  Bleibach and Waldkirch.

Balian paid 30,000 dinars for freeing 7000 of those unable to pay from the treasury of the city. The large golden [[Christian cross]] that had been placed over the [[Dome of the Rock]] by the Crusaders was pulled down and all Muslim prisoners of war taken by the Crusaders were released by Saladin who according to the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] scholar and historian [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]], numbered close to 3000. Saladin allowed many of the noble women of the city to leave without paying any ransom. For example, a [[Byzantine]] queen living a monastic life in the city was allowed to leave the city with her retinue and associates as also [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the queen of Jerusalem and wife of the captured King [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy]]. Saladin also granted her safe passage to visit her captive husband in [[Nablus]]. The Native Christians were allowed to remain in the city while those of Crusader origin were allowed to leave Jerusalem for other lands along with their goods through a safe passage via [[Akko]] by paying a ransom of 10 dinars. The wealthy including the [[Latin patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Heraclius]] left with treasure-laden wagons and relics from the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. The Crusaders took the ornaments and treasures of their churches with them. The wealthy and the Crusaders didn't bother to ransom the poor who were unable to pay leaving them to be ransomed into slavery. Saladin's brother, [[Al-Adil]] was moved by the sight and asked Saladin for 1000 of them as reward of his services. Saladin granted his wish and Al-Adil immediately released them all. Heraclius upon seeing asked Saladin for some slaves to liberate. He was granted 700 while Balian was granted 500 and all of them were freed by them. All the aged people who could not pay the ransom were freed by orders of Saladin and allowed to leave the city. He then proceeded to free 1000 more captives upon request of Muzaffar al-Din Ibn Ali Kuchuk who claimed they were from his hometown of [[Urfa]]. In order to control the departing population he ordered the gates of the city to be closed. At each gate of the city a commander was placed who checked the movement of the Crusaders and made sure only those who paid the ransom left the city. The grand masters of the [[Templars]] and [[Hospitallers]] were approached to donate money for the release of the poor Crusaders. However they refused and a riot almost erupted after which they were forced to donate the money. Saladin then assigned some of his officers the job to ensure safe arrival of the Crusaders in Christian lands. 15000 of those who could not pay the ransom were ransomed into slavery. According to [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]], 7000 of them were men and 8000 were women and children. Amazed by the amount of treasure carried away by the Crusaders, he reported to Saladin that the value of the whole treasure could not be less than 200,000 dinars.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Kehl (1796–97)	|||	Battle of Schliengen	|||	Throughout the summer of 1796, the French and the Austrians had chased each other back and forth across the south German states. By October, the Austrian force, under the command of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], had pushed the French back to the Rhine. With the conclusion of the [[Battle of Schliengen]] on 24 October, the French army withdrew south and west toward the Rhine. The French commander, [[Jean-Victor-Marie Moreau|Jean-Victor Moreau]], offered an armistice that the archduke was inclined to accept. He wanted to secure the Rhine crossings so he could send troops to northern Italy to relieve [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser]] at besieged [[Siege of Mantua (1796–1797)|Mantua]]; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that. However, his brother, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the [[Aulic Council]] categorically refused such an armistice, forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at [[Siege of Hüningen (1796–97)|Hüningen]] and Kehl.  These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter.	|||		|||		|||
0	Siege of Kolberg (1807)	|||	American Revolutionary War	|||	Because of the delay in the French advance, Napoleon replaced Teulié as the commander of the siege forces with division general [[Louis Henri Loison]]; Frederick William III replaced Lucadou as the commander of the fortress with major [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]]  and out of considerations for an envisioned British landfall at Kolberg - he feared that a French-born commander might irritate his British supporters, while on the other hand Gneisenau had been in British service during the [[American Revolutionary War]].	|||	Siege	|||	Mid-March to April	|||

[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] put the siege force under the command of [[Louis Henri Loison|Loison]], [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] entrusted [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] with the defense. In early April, the siege forces were for a short time commanded by [[Edouard Mortier|Mortier]], who had marched a large force from [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|besieged Swedish Stralsund]] to Kolberg but was ordered to return when Stralsund's defenders gained ground. Other reinforcements came from states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] ([[Kingdom of Württemberg]], Saxon duchies and the [[Duchy of Nassau]]), the [[Kingdom of Holland]], and France.	|||		|||		|||

On 15 December, the first relief attempt was defeated at the [[Battle of Colenso]]. Temporarily unnerved, the relief force commander, General [[Redvers Henry Buller]], suggested that White either break out or destroy his stores and ammunition and surrender. White could not break out because his horses and draught animals were weak from lack of grazing and forage, but also refused to surrender.	|||	Siege	|||		|||

This port was used by the New England fishing fleet as it was the closest mainland North American British port to the fishing grounds; however, the Canso Islands (including Grassy Island) were contested by both Britain and France.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||
0	Siege of Orléans	|||	Battle of Patay	|||	The [[Loire Campaign]] began a couple of weeks later, after a period of rest and reinforcement. Volunteers of men and supplies swelled the French army, eager to serve under Joan of Arc's banner. Even the ostracized constable [[Arthur de Richemont]] was eventually permitted to join the campaign.  After a series of brief sieges and battles at [[Battle of Jargeau|Jargeau]] (June 12), [[Battle of Meung-sur-Loire|Meung]] (June 15) and [[Battle of Beaugency (1429)|Beaugency]] (June 17), the Loire was back in French hands.   An English reinforcement army rushing from Paris under John Talbot was defeated at the [[Battle of Patay]] shortly after (June 18), the first significant field victory for French arms in years. The English commanders, the Earl of Suffolk and Lord Talbot, were taken prisoner in this campaign. Only thereafter did the French feel safe enough to accede to Joan's request for a march on Rheims.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Petersburg	|||	Battle of the Wilderness	|||	On May 4, Grant and Meade's Army of the Potomac crossed the [[Rapidan River]] and entered the area known as the Wilderness of [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania]], beginning the six-week [[Overland Campaign]]. At the bloody but tactically inconclusive [[Battle of the Wilderness]] (May 5–7) and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] (May 8–21), Grant failed to destroy Lee's army but, unlike his predecessors, did not retreat after the battles; he repeatedly moved his army leftward to the southeast in a campaign that kept Lee on the defensive and moved ever closer to Richmond. Grant spent the remainder of May maneuvering and fighting minor battles with the Confederate army as he attempted to turn Lee's flank and lure him into the open. Grant knew that his larger army and base of manpower in the North could sustain a war of attrition better than Lee and the Confederacy could. This theory was tested at the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]] (May 31 – June 12) when Grant's army once again came into contact with Lee's near [[Mechanicsville, Virginia|Mechanicsville]]. He chose to engage Lee's army directly, by ordering a frontal assault on the Confederate fortified positions on June 3. This attack was repulsed with heavy losses. Cold Harbor was a battle that Grant regretted more than any other and Northern newspapers thereafter frequently referred to him as a 'butcher'. Although Grant suffered high losses during the campaign—approximately 50,000 casualties, or 41%—Lee lost even higher percentages of his men—approximately 32,000, or 46%—losses that could not be replaced.	|||	Background	|||		|||

Although they captured and occupied the fortress, most of the army was withdrawn to the west bank of the Rhine due to the onset of winter in December.  During the winter, Austrian field marshal [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] began gathering forces of the empire at a camp near [[Heilbronn]] to oppose the French.  By the spring of 1734 these forces were still significantly smaller than those of France, which had nearly 70,000 men in the field.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)	|||	Battle of Eupatoria	|||	The '''Siege of Sevastopol''' lasted from September 1854 until September 1855, during the [[Crimean War]]. The allies ([[Second French Empire|French]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]) landed at [[Battle of Eupatoria|Eupatoria]] on 14 September 1854, intending to make a triumphal march to Sevastopol, the capital of the [[Crimea]], with 50,000 men. The {{convert|56|km|adj=on}} traverse took a year of fighting against the Russians. Major battles along the way were [[Battle of Alma|Alma]] (September 1854), [[Battle of Balaclava|Balaklava]] (October 1854), [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]] (November 1854), [[Battle of the Chernaya|Tchernaya]] (August 1855), [[Battle of the Great Redan|Redan]] (September 1855), and, finally, [[Sevastopol]] (September 1855).  During the siege, the allied navy undertook six bombardments of the capital, on 17 October 1854; and on 9 April, 6 June, 17 June, 17 August, and 5 September 1855.	|||		|||		|||
0	Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)	|||	Battle of Stalingrad	|||	Although a German success in the end, the operation had taken much longer than the Germans had imagined. [[Operation Blau]], [[Army Group South]]'s advance towards [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and the [[Caucasus]] was just beginning, and the German offensive would not have the 11th Army to support them.  Instead of having the 11th Army to help it on its quest to capture Stalingrad, the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] under Paulus would be without crucial support that ultimately contributed to its defeat.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

After the failed [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|Siege of Toulon]] in the following year, no significant military event took place on the Italian front until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].	|||	Epilogue	|||		|||
0	Siege of Yorktown	|||	Battle of the Chesapeake	|||	The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. When word of de Grasse's decision arrived, the combined armies began moving south toward Virginia, engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional troops and providing a naval blockade of Yorktown.  He was transporting 500,000 silver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana, Cuba, to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army.  In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led by [[Thomas Graves, 1st Baron Graves|Sir Thomas Graves]] that came to relieve Cornwallis at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]. As a result of this victory, de Grasse blocked any escape by sea for Cornwallis. By late September Washington and Rochambeau arrived, and the army and naval forces completely surrounded Cornwallis.	|||		|||		|||
0	Siege of Yorktown	|||	Yorktown campaign	|||	The '''Siege of Yorktown''', also known as the '''Battle of Yorktown''', the '''Surrender at Yorktown''' or the '''German Battle''', ending on October 19, 1781 at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], was a decisive victory by a combined force of American [[Continental Army]] troops led by General [[George Washington]] and [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French Army troops]] led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] over a [[British Army]] commanded by British lord and Lieutenant General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]].  The culmination of the [[Yorktown campaign]], the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.	|||		|||		|||

0	Sinai and Palestine Campaign	|||	Battle of Megiddo (1918)	|||	After a period of [[stalemate in Southern Palestine]] from April to October 1917, General [[Edmund Allenby]] captured [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]] defended by the III Corps (which had fought at Gallipoli). Having weakened the Ottoman defences which had stretched almost continually from Gaza to Beersheba, they were finally captured by 8 November, after the [[Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe]], the [[Battle of Hareira and Sheria]] and the [[Third Battle of Gaza]], when the pursuit began. During the subsequent operations, about {{convert|50|mi|km}} of formerly Ottoman territory, was captured as a result of the EEF victories at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], fought between 10 and 14 November, and the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Battle of Jerusalem]] fought between 17 November and 30 December. Serious losses on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in March 1918 during [[Erich Ludendorff]]'s German [[Spring Offensive]], forced the British Empire to send reinforcements from the EEF. During this time, two unsuccessful attacks were made [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|to capture Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|to capture Es Salt]] in March and April 1918, before Allenby's force resumed the offensive during the [[manoeuvre warfare]] of the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. The successful infantry battles at [[Battle of Tulkarm|Tulkarm]] and [[Battle of Tabsor|Tabsor]] created gaps in the Ottoman front line, allowing the pursuing [[Desert Mounted Corps]] to [[encirclement|encircle]] the infantry fighting in the [[Judean Hills]] and fight the [[Battle of Nazareth]] and [[Battle of Samakh]], capturing [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah, Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin|Jenin]] and [[Capture of Tiberias|Tiberias]]. In the process the EEF destroyed three Ottoman armies during the [[Battle of Sharon]], the [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Battle of Nablus]] and the [[Third Transjordan attack]], capturing thousands of prisoners and large quantities of equipment. [[Capture of Damascus (1918)|Damascus]], and [[Battle of Aleppo (1918)|Aleppo]] were captured during the subsequent pursuit, before the Ottoman Empire agreed to the [[Armistice of Mudros]] on 30 October 1918, ending the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The [[British Mandate of Palestine]], and the [[French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon]] were created to administer the captured territories.	|||		|||		|||
0	Sinai and Palestine Campaign	|||	Turkish War of Independence	|||	The campaign was generally not well known or understood during the war. The English people thought of it as a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India were more interested in the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of [[Baghdad]].  The long-lasting effect of this campaign was the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], when France won the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] for [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], while the British Empire won the mandates for [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]]. The [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] came into existence in 1923 after the [[Turkish War of Independence]] ended the Ottoman Empire.

0	War of the Three Henrys	|||	Battle of Coutras	|||	For the first part of the war, the royalists and the Catholic League were uneasy allies against their common enemy, the Huguenots. Henry sent Joyeuse into the field against Navarre, while he himself intended to meet the approaching German and Swiss armies. At the [[Battle of Coutras]], Navarre defeated the royal army led by Joyeuse; the duke himself was slain at the battle. It was the first victory won by the Huguenots in the battlefield. For his part, Henry III successfully prevented the junction of the German and Swiss armies. The Swiss were his allies, and had come to invade France to free him from subjection; but Henry III insisted that their invasion was not in his favor, but against him, forcing them to return home. The Germans, led by Fabien I, Burgrave of Dohna, wanted to fight against the Duke of Guise, in order to win a victory like Coutras. He recruited some of the retreating Swiss, who had no scruple fighting against Guise. But at the [[Battle of Vimory]], Guise took the Germans by surprise, and routed them.	|||		|||		|||

The invasion started with the Western Allies crossing the [[River Rhine]] in March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to Austria in the south before the Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945. This is known as the 'Central Europe Campaign' in United States military histories.	|||		|||		|||
0	Western Front (World War II)	|||	Battle of Dunkirk	|||	In May 1940, the Germans launched the Battle of France. The Western Allies (primarily the French, Belgian and British land forces) soon collapsed under the onslaught of the so-called '''[[blitzkrieg]]''' strategy. The majority of the British and elements of the French forces escaped [[Battle of Dunkirk|at Dunkirk]]. With the fighting ended, the Germans began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain. If the British refused to agree to a peace treaty, one option was to [[Operation Sealion|invade]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', had suffered serious losses in Norway, and in order to even consider an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]], Germany's Air Force (the Luftwaffe) had to first gain [[air superiority]] or [[air supremacy]].	|||	1939–40: Axis victories	|||	 Battles for Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France 	|||

The plan called ''Wacht am Rhein ('Watch on the Rhine')'' was to attack through the Ardennes and swing North to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the US First Army. Initial successes in bad weather, which gave them cover from the Allied air forces, resulted in a German penetration of over {{Convert|50|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} to within less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} of the [[Meuse river|Meuse]]. Having been taken by surprise, the Allies regrouped and the Germans were stopped by a combined air and land counter-attack which eventually pushed them back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.	|||	 1944–45: The Second Front ==&lt;!-- [[West European Campaign (1944-1945)]] redirects to this section heading change this then please change that--&g	|||	Winter counter-offensives	|||

[[Airborne forces|Airborne troops]] would fly in from the UK and take bridges over the main rivers of the German-occupied Netherlands in three main cities; [[Eindhoven]], [[Nijmegen]], and [[Arnhem]]. The [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] would punch through the German lines along the Maas-Schelde Kanal and link up with the airborne troops of the [[101st Airborne Division|US 101st Airborne]] in Eindhoven, the [[82nd Airborne Division|US 82nd]] at Nijmegen and the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st]] at Arnhem. If all went well XXX Corps would advance into Germany without any remaining major obstacles. XXX Corps was able to advance beyond six of the seven airborne-held bridges, but was unable to link up with the troops near the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem. The result was the near-destruction of the 1st Airborne Division during the [[Battle of Arnhem]]. The offensive ended with Arnhem remaining in German hands and the Allies holding an extended salient from the Belgian border to the area between Nijmegen and Arnhem.	|||	 1944–45: The Second Front ==&lt;!-- [[West European Campaign (1944-1945)]] redirects to this section heading change this then please change that--&g	|||	 Operation Market Garden 	|||

They decided to make a stand at the hamlet of Wounded Knee, the renowned site of the last large-scale [[Wounded Knee Massacre|massacre]] of the [[American Indian Wars]]. They occupied the town and announced their demand for the removal of Wilson from office and for immediate revival of treaty talks with the U.S. government. [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]] were prominent spokesmen during the occupation; they often addressed the press, knowing they were making their cause known directly to the American public.

1	Action of 24 June 1801	|||	French Revolutionary Wars	|||	The '''Action of 24 June 1801''' was a minor naval engagement during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. A British [[ship of the line]], [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] under Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]] was passing westwards through the Southern Mediterranean near [[Derna, Libya|Cape Derna]] when it encountered a much larger French squadron under [[Rear admiral|Contre-Amiral]] [[Honoré Ganteaume]] that was also returning westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in [[Egypt]]. Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel was in and turned to flee, the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship. At 14:00, three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships before the rest of the French squadron could join the engagement. Turning towards the enemy, Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours ''Swiftsure'' was surrounded. Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape, the British captain surrendered.	|||		|||		|||

While cruising in the Northern [[Bay of Biscay]], the British [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]] [[HMS Thames (1758)|HMS ''Thames'']], under Captain [[James Cotes (Royal Navy officer)|James Cotes]], encountered the much larger French frigate [[French frigate Uranie (1788)|''Uranie'']], under Captain [[Jean-François Tartu]]. The ships engaged, with each suffering severe damage until they separated after nearly four hours of continual combat. Cotes ordered his crew to make hasty repairs, intending to resume the battle, but ''Uranie'' ' s crew, with their captain dead, slipped away while ''Thames'' was unable to manoeuvre. At 16:00, with repairs  on ''Thames'' ongoing, a French squadron of three frigates and a [[brig]], under Captain [[Zacharie Allemand]], arrived, firing on ''Thames'' as they approached. Outnumbered, Cotes surrendered his ship to Allemand, who commended Cotes on his resistance to the far larger ''Uranie''.	|||		|||		|||

The Dutch ships were intercepted in the [[North Sea]] within hours of leaving port, {{convert|30|nmi|km}} northwest of the [[Texel]], by the British ship [[HMS Sirius (1797)|HMS ''Sirius'']]. Both Dutch vessels were carrying large quantities of military supplies and [[French Army|French soldiers]], reinforcements for the French and Irish forces participating in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Although the rebellion had been defeated a month earlier, word of the British victory had not yet reached the European continent, and the Dutch force was intended to supplement a larger French squadron sent earlier in October. The French had already been defeated at the [[Battle of Tory Island]] and the Dutch suffered a similar outcome, both ships defeated in turn by the larger and better armed British vessel.	|||		|||		|||

Two [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[ships of the line]], [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] were intercepted while returning to Britain through the [[Celtic Sea]] by a large French squadron. The French squadron had sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in search of an inward bound British convoy in October, but instead encountered the two British ships returning from escorting an outward-bound convoy. There had been no warning of the French approach as the British force assigned to watch Brest was absent at [[Plymouth]] due to the policy of operating a distant [[blockade]].	|||		|||		|||
1	Action of the Hohenzollern Redoubt	|||	Battle of Loos	|||	The '''Action of the Hohenzollern Redoubt''' took place 13 – 19 October 1915, towards the end and immediately after the [[Battle of Loos]] (25 September – 15 October 1915), at the [[Hohenzollern Redoubt (fortification)|Hohenzollern Redoubt]] ({{lang|de|''Hohenzollernwerk''}}) near [[Auchy-les-Mines]] in France on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[World War I]].

1	Aleutian Islands Campaign	|||	World War II	|||	The '''Aleutian Islands Campaign''' was a struggle over the [[Aleutian Islands]], part of the [[Alaska Territory]], in the [[American Theater (World War II)|American theater]] and the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]] starting on 3 June 1942. A small [[Japan]]ese force occupied the islands of [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], but the remoteness of the islands and the difficulties of weather and terrain meant that it took nearly a year for a far larger U.S./Canadian force to eject them. The islands' strategic value was their ability to control Pacific [[Great circle|Great Circle]] routes. This control of the Pacific transportation routes is why [[U.S. General]] [[Billy Mitchell]] stated to the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1935, 'I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.' The Japanese reasoned that control of the Aleutians would prevent a possible U.S. attack across the Northern Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. feared that the islands would be used as bases from which to launch aerial assaults against the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].	|||		|||		|||

1	Battle of Ardahan	|||	Caucasus Campaign	|||	The operation was part of what the [[Russian Empire]] viewed the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]].

Russia had taken the fortress of [[Kars]] from the Turks during the [[Russo–Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1877 and feared a campaign into the Caucasus, a [[Caucasus Campaign]], aimed at retaking Kars and the port of [[Batum]]. The Ottoman generalship and organization were negligible compared to the Allies. Caucasus Campaign planned to be a distracting effect on Russian forces. Enver hoped a success would facilitate opening the route to [[Tbilisi]] and beyond, with a revolt of [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] Muslims another strategic goal was to cut [[Baku-Batumi pipeline|Russian access]] to its [[Oil industry in Azerbaijan|hydrocarbon resources]] around the [[Caspian Sea]].
