ÔÅµ	-1	Winter War	|||	Battle of Petsamo (1939)	|||	In battles from Ladoga Karelia all the way north to the Arctic port of [[Battle of Petsamo (1939)|Petsamo]], the Finns used guerrilla tactics. The Red Army was superior in numbers and [[materiel]], but the Finns used the advantages of speed, tactics, and [[economy of force]]. Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the [[battle of Raate road]], the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces. With Soviet forces divided into smaller pieces, the Finns could deal with them individually and attack from all sides.	|||	Defence of Finland	|||	Finnish tactics	|||
