The short distance from Sicily meant [[landing craft]] could launch from there directly, rather than be carried by ship. The [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]] of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]], under [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Miles Dempsey|Miles C.

Montgomery was strongly opposed to ''Operation Baytown''. He predicted it would be a waste of effort since it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work, and the only effect of the operation would be to place the Eighth Army {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the main landing at [[Salerno]]. He was proved correct; after ''Operation Baytown'' the British Eighth Army marched 300 miles north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineer obstacles.	|||	Background	|||	Allied plan	|||

However, with the signing of the armistice with the Italians on 3 September the picture changed. It was decided to carry the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]] to Taranto using British warships, seize the port and several nearby airfields and follow up by shipping in [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|British V Corps]] and a number of fighter squadrons. The airborne division, which was undergoing training exercises in two locations {{convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on}} apart, was ordered on 4 September to embark on 8 September.

Washington was finding it extremely difficult to keep his army together, even without any major fighting against the British. In 1780 actual mutinies broke out in the American camp.

He received reinforcements, but his light infantry under Tarleton was decisively defeated by [[Daniel Morgan]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781. In spite of this, Cornwallis decided to proceed, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support. General [[Nathanael Greene]], who replaced General Gates, evaded contact with Cornwallis while seeking reinforcements. By March, Greene's army had grown to the point where he felt that he could face Cornwallis directly. In the key [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], Cornwallis drove Greene's much larger army off the battlefield, but in doing so suffered casualties amounting to one-fourth of his army. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining up than expected because the Patriots put heavy pressure on them and their families, who would become hostages.  Cornwallis decided to retreat to coastal [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] for resupply and reinforcement, leaving the interior of the Carolinas and Georgia open to Greene.

Patriot protests escalated into boycotts and the destruction of a shipment of tea at the [[Boston Tea Party]]. The British government punished Massachusetts by closing the port of Boston and taking away self-government. The Patriots responded by [[Suffolk Resolves|setting up a shadow government]] that took control of the province outside of Boston. Twelve other colonies supported Massachusetts, formed a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance, and set up committees and conventions that effectively seized power from the royal governments. In April 1775 fighting broke out between Massachusetts militia units and British regulars [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|at Lexington and Concord]]. The Continental Congress appointed General [[George Washington]] to take charge of militia units besieging British forces in Boston, forcing them to evacuate the city in March 1776.

British forces had initial success in bringing Georgia and South Carolina under control in 1779 and 1780, but the Loyalist surge was far weaker than expected. In 1781 British forces moved through Virginia, but their escape was blocked by a French [[Battle of the Chesapeake|naval victory]]. Washington took control of a  [[Siege of Yorktown|Franco-American siege at Yorktown]] and captured the entire British force of over 7,000 men. The defeat at Yorktown finally turned the British Parliament against the war, and in early 1782 they voted to end offensive operations in North America. The war against France and Spain continued however, with the British defending Gibraltar against a long running Franco-Spanish siege, while the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] scored key victories, especially the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in 1782. In 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by what is now Canada to the north, [[Florida]] to the south, and the [[Mississippi River]] to the west.

[[Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened. This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.	|||	Conduct of operations	|||	Stalingrad: Winter 1942	|||

-1	English Civil War	|||	Second English Civil War	|||	The '''English Civil War''' (1642–1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians ('[[Roundhead]]s') and Royalists ('[[Cavalier]]s') in the [[Kingdom of England]] over, principally, the manner of its government. The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642–46) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648–49) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649–51) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.	|||		|||		|||
-1	Finnish War	|||	Battle of Revolax	|||	Under Colonel [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]] the Swedish army [[Battle of Siikajoki|counter-attacked at Siikajoki]] and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at [[Battle of Revolax]] Swedish army under Colonel [[Johan Adam Cronstedt]] started the Swedish advance towards the South. These successes yielded promotion to Field Marshal to [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]]. Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were mostly halted due to the thaw, the exception was the brigade under Colonel [[Johan August Sandels]] which swiftly advanced towards [[Kuopio]]. [[Nikolay Tuchkov]], a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort on his way, thus reducing his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far as [[Hamina]] (in Russian '[[Old Finland]]').	|||	 February – May 1808 	|||		|||
-1	First Anglo-Dutch War	|||	Battle of Portland	|||	Though the politicians were close to ending the conflict, the war had a momentum of its own. Over the winter of 1652-53, the English repaired their ships and considered their position. Robert Blake wrote the [[Sailing and Fighting Instructions]], a major overhaul of [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|naval tactics]], containing the first formal description of the [[line of battle]]. By February 1653 the English were ready to challenge the Dutch, and in the three-day [[Battle of Portland]] in March they drove them out of the Channel. Their success saw an abrupt end to the English desire for peace. On 18 March the States General sent a detailed peace proposal to the English Parliament, but it replied on 11 April by reiterating the same demands that had put off Pauw in June the previous year, to be accepted before negotiations were even to begin. The States General ignored this, and on 30 April asked for negotiations to begin in a neutral country; on 23 May Cromwell, having dissolved the pro-war ''[[Rump Parliament]]'', responded that he would receive Dutch envoys in London; on 5 June the States General decided to send them.	|||	Conduct of the war	|||		|||
-1	First Anglo-Dutch War	|||	Battle of Scheveningen	|||	The final battle of the war was the costly [[Battle of Scheveningen]] in August. The Dutch desperately tried to break the English blockade; after heavy fighting with much damage on both sides, the defeated Dutch retreated to the [[Texel]], but the English had to abandon the blockade. Tromp was killed early in the battle, a blow to morale which increased the Dutch desire to end the war. Similar feelings arose in England. Although many had been enriched by the war (Dutch prizes taken during the war, about 1200 merchantmen or 8% of their total mercantile fleet, amounted to double the value of England's entire ocean-going merchant fleet) trade as a whole had suffered. Cromwell himself was exasperated that two Protestant nations should exhaust themselves in this useless conflict that he had started, while Catholic Spain profited. He decided to begin negotiations in earnest with the four Dutch envoys who had arrived in late June. Hostilities largely ended until the conclusion of peace.	|||	Conduct of the war	|||		|||
-1	First Balkan War	|||	Battle of Elli	|||	The war's first major fleet action, the [[Battle of Elli]], was fought two days later, on {{OldStyleDate|16 December|1912|3 December}}. The Ottoman fleet, with four battleships, nine destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed to the entrance of the straits. The lighter Ottoman vessels remained behind, but the battleship squadron moved on north under cover of the forts at [[Kumkale]] and engaged the Greek fleet, coming from Imbros, at 9:40. Leaving the older battleships to follow their original course, Kountouriotis led the ''Averof'' into independent action: utilizing her superior speed, she cut across the Ottoman fleet's bow. Under fire from two sides, the Ottomans were quickly forced to withdraw to the Dardanelles.	|||	 Operations 	|||	 Greek theater 	|||	Naval operations in the Aegean and Ionian seas

-1	French Revolutionary Wars	|||	Battle of Fleurus (1794)	|||	The Revolutionary Wars began from increasing political pressure on King [[Louis XVI of France]] to prove his loyalty to the new direction France was taking. In the spring of 1792, France declared war on [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], which responded with a coordinated invasion of the country that was eventually turned back at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in September 1792. The victory rejuvenated the French nation and emboldened the [[National Convention]] to [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolish the monarchy]].  A series of victories by the [[French Revolutionary Armies|new French armies]] abruptly ended with defeat at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] in the spring of 1793. The remainder of the year witnessed additional defeats for the French, and these difficult times allowed the [[Jacobins]] to rise to power and impose the [[Reign of Terror]] as a method of attempting to unify the nation. In 1794, the situation improved dramatically for the French, as huge victories at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] against the Austrians and at the [[Battle of the Black Mountain|Black Mountain]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] signaled the start of a new stage in the wars. By 1795, the French had captured the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and knocked Spain and Prussia out of the war with the [[Peace of Basel]]. A hitherto unknown general called [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] began his first [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|campaign in Italy]] in April 1796. In less than a year, French armies under Napoleon decimated the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] forces and evicted them from the Italian peninsula, winning almost every battle and capturing 150,000 prisoners. With French forces marching towards [[Vienna]], the Austrians sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], ending the First Coalition against the Republic.	|||		|||		|||
-1	French Revolutionary Wars	|||	Battle of Hohenlinden	|||	Napoleon's arrival from the Middle East led to the fall of the [[French Directory|Directory]] in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]], with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. This latest effort culminated in a decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] in June 1800, after which the Austrians withdrew from the peninsula once again. Another crushing French triumph at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] in Bavaria forced the Austrians to seek peace for a second time, leading to the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] in 1801. With Austria and Russia out of the war, the United Kingdom found itself increasingly isolated and agreed to the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with Napoleon's government in 1802, concluding the Revolutionary Wars. The lingering tensions proved too difficult to contain, however, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] began a few years later with the formation of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]].	|||		|||		|||
-1	French Revolutionary Wars	|||	Battle of Stockach (1799)	|||	In March 1799, the Army of the Danube engaged in two major battles, both in the southwestern German theater. At the intensely fought [[Battle of Ostrach]], 21–2 March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, under the command of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], defeated Jourdan's Army of the Danube. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions to the west at Messkirch (Mößkirch, Meßkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. At the second battle, in [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], on 25 March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he himself established a base at Hornberg. From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, [[Jean Augustin Ernouf]], and traveled to Paris to ask for more and better troops and, ultimately, to request a medical leave.	|||	War of the Second Coalition	|||	1799	|||

British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] defied orders and attacked the Danish fleet in harbor at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]], destroying much of the fleet of one of France's more steady allies during the period. An armistice prevented him from continuing into the [[Baltic Sea]] to attack the Russian fleet at Reval ([[Tallinn]]). Meanwhile, off Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under [[Linois]] rebuffed a first British attack under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Saumarez]] in the [[First Battle of Algeciras]], capturing a line-of-battle ship.

The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], while the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet invasion]] commenced on 17 September following the [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]]-[[Shigenori Tōgō|Tōgō]] agreement that terminated the Russian and Japanese [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|hostilities]] in the east on 16 September.   The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty]].	|||		|||		|||

On April 24, 1980, [[Operation Eagle Claw]] failed, resulting in the deaths of eight American servicemen, one Iranian civilian, as well as the destruction of two aircraft. Published documents dated two weeks before the operation claim that National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, discussed the potential for an invasion of Iran through Turkish bases and territory, though this plan was never executed.	|||		|||		|||

Complicating matters, the [[Kurdistan Worker's Party]] or PKK was present in Iraq. On friendly terms with the PUK, the PKK allegedly began fighting with ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and civilians who supported the KDP.  In response, Turkish forces launched [[Operation Hammer (1997)|Operation Hammer]] in May, in a violent attempt to root out the PKK from Iraqi Kurdistan.

-1	Nivelle Offensive	|||	Battle of La Malmaison	|||	The collapse of the Nivelle strategy and the high number of French casualties led to [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] and the dismissal of Nivelle, his replacement by Pétain, and the adoption of a defensive strategy while the French army recuperated. Fighting known as the Battle of the Observatories continued for local advantage all summer on the Chemin des Dames and along the Moronvilliers heights east of Rheims. In late October the French conducted a limited-objective attack on the west end of the Chemin-des-Dames in the [[Battle of La Malmaison]], which forced the Germans to retire across the Ailette valley.	|||		|||		|||

Allied [[infantry]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[division (military)|divisions]] began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target {{Convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the [[Normandy]] coast was divided into five sectors: [[Utah Beach|Utah]], [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], [[Gold Beach|Gold]], [[Juno Beach|Juno]], and [[Sword Beach]]. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.	|||		|||		|||
-1	North African Campaign	|||	Battle of Beda Fomm	|||	Some 40,000 Italians were captured in and around the two ports, with the remainder of the Tenth Army retreating along the coast road back to [[El Agheila]]. [[Richard O'Connor]] sent the 7th Armoured Division across the desert, with a small reconnaissance group reaching [[Beda Fomm]] some ninety minutes before the Italians, cutting off their retreat.  Though desperate attempts were made to overcome the British force at the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]], the Italians were unable to  break through, and the remnants of the retreating army surrendered. Thus, over the course of 10 weeks Allied forces had destroyed the Italian Tenth Army and reached El Agheila, taking 130,000 prisoners of war in the process.	|||	Western Desert Campaign	|||		|||

-1	North African Campaign	|||	Operation Brevity	|||	The Allied forces soon launched a small-scale counter-attack called [[Operation Brevity]]. This was an attempt to push the Axis forces off the key passes at the border, which gained some initial success, but the advanced position could not be held. Brevity was then followed up by a much larger-scale offensive, [[Operation Battleaxe]].  Intended to relieve the siege at Tobruk, this operation also failed.	|||	Western Desert Campaign	|||		|||
-1	North African Campaign	|||	Operation Crusader	|||	Following the failure of Operation Battleaxe, Archibald Wavell was relieved of command and replaced by [[Claude Auchinleck]]. The Western Desert Force was reinforced with a second corps, XXX Corps, with the two corps forming the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]]. Eighth Army was made up of army forces from the Commonwealth nations, including the British Army, the [[Australian Army]], the [[British Indian Army]], the [[New Zealand Army]], the [[South African Army]], and  the [[Sudan Defence Force]]. There was also a brigade of [[Free French]] under [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]]. The new formation launched a new offensive, [[Operation Crusader]], in November 1941. After a see-saw battle, the [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|70th Division]] garrisoning Tobruk was relieved and the Axis forces were forced to fall back. By January 1942, the [[front line]] was again at El Agheila.	|||	Western Desert Campaign	|||		|||

-1	Operation Overlord	|||	Juno Beach	|||	The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), and General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The [[Normandy]] coast was chosen as the site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at [[Utah Beach|Utah]] and [[Omaha Beach]]es, the British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach]]es, and Canadians at [[Juno Beach]]. To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead, special technology was developed, including two artificial ports called [[Mulberry harbour]]s and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]]. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial [[military deception]], [[Operation Bodyguard]], using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. [[Adolf Hitler]] placed German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] in charge of developing fortifications all along the [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an invasion.	|||		|||		|||

The Corinthians, outraged by these actions, encouraged Potidaea to revolt and assured them that they would ally with them should they revolt from Athens. Meanwhile, the Corinthians were unofficially aiding Potidaea by sneaking contingents of men into the besieged city to help defend it. This was a direct violation of the Thirty Years' Peace, which had (among other things) stipulated that the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League would respect each other's autonomy and internal affairs.	|||	 Prelude 	|||	 Breakdown of the peace 	|||

Soult's forces faced 12,000 men represented by the line regiments, militia and ''[[ordenança]]'' of the province of [[Trás-os-Montes Province|Tras-os-Montes]]. Commanded by [[Francisco da Silveira]], these forces quickly retreated amid riot and disorder, and within two days of crossing the border Soult had taken the fortress of [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]].{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=178}} Swinging west, the French were confronted by 25,000 unprepared and undisciplined Portuguese. While waiting for Soult's army to arrive, the Portuguese militia lynched their own commander, [[Bernardim Freire de Andrade]], who wanted to retreat. On 20 March, 16,000 of Soult's professional troops of the [[II Corps (Grande Armée)|II Corps]] advanced and killed 4,000 Portuguese troops in the [[Battle of Braga (1809)|Battle of Braga]]. A similar mismatch occurred when the French reached [[Porto]]. In the [[First Battle of Porto]] on 29 March, the Portuguese defenders panicked and thousands drowned trying to flee across the [[Douro]] River. It was a French victory; with fewer than 500 casualties Soult had secured Portugal's second city with its valuable dockyards and arsenals intact. The Portuguese sustained appalling losses, losing 200 guns and between 6,000 and 20,000 men dead, wounded or captured.{{sfn|Gates|2001|p=142}} The French booty included immense stocks of food and munitions, and 30 shiploads of wine.{{sfn|Esdaile|2003|p=179}} Soult occupied northern Portugal but halted at Porto to refit his army before advancing on Lisbon.	|||	Second Portuguese campaign, 1808–1809	|||		|||

Lefebvre and Marshal [[Claude Victor-Perrin]] offered a careless chase that ended in humiliation at the [[Battle of Valmaseda]], where their scattered troops were handled by La Romana's repatriated Spanish veterans and escaped to safety. The campaign in the south, where Napoleon's main army overran the unprotected Spanish centre in a devastating attack near [[Battle of Burgos|Burgos]], ended quickly. The Spanish militias{{mdash}}untrained and unable to form [[infantry square]]s{{mdash}}scattered in the face of massed French cavalry, while the [[Spanish Royal Guard]] and [[Walloon Guards]] stood their ground in vain and were overcome by [[Antoine Charles Louis Lasalle]] and his ''sabreurs''.

Blake's isolated army reversed direction on 17 November and dug in at the [[Battle of Espinosa]]. His lines repelled French attacks over a day and night of vicious fighting, before giving up the next day. Blake again outmarched Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] and escaped with a rump army to Santander, but the Spanish front had been fragmented and the Imperial armies raced forward over undefended provinces.

The French occupation destroyed the [[Government of Spain|Spanish administration]], which fragmented into quarrelling [[Junta (Peninsular War)|provincial ''juntas'']]. In 1810, a reconstituted national government, the [[Cádiz Cortes]]{{mdash}}effectively a government-in-exile{{mdash}}fortified itself in [[Cádiz]] but could not raise effective armies because it was [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged]] by 70,000 French troops. British and Portuguese forces eventually secured Portugal, using it as a safe position from which to launch campaigns against the French army and to provide whatever supplies they could get to the Spanish, while the Spanish armies and guerrillas tied down vast numbers of Napoleon's troops. These combined regular and irregular allied forces prevented Napoleon's [[Marshal of France#French Empire|marshals]] from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces by restricting French control of territory and the war continued through years of stalemate.	|||		|||		|||

He departed for Germany in 1520, leaving the Dutch cardinal [[Adrian of Utrecht]] to rule Castile in his absence.  Soon, a series of anti-government riots broke out in the cities, and local city councils (''Comunidades'') took power.  The rebels chose Charles' own mother, Queen Joanna, as an alternative ruler, hoping they could control her madness.  The rebel movement took on a radical [[manorialism|anti-feudal]] dimension, supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility.  On April 23, 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the [[Battle of Villalar]].  The following day, rebel leaders [[Juan López de Padilla|Juan de Padilla]], [[Juan Bravo (rebel)|Juan Bravo]], and [[Francisco Maldonado]] were beheaded.  The army of the comuneros fell apart.

The Rhodesian Army was merged with guerrilla forces to form the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]], with the Rhodesian security forces being merged with ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. Joshua Nkomo was given a series of cabinet positions. However, Mugabe was torn between keeping his coalition stable and pressures to meet the expectations of his followers for social change. Clashes between ZANLA and ZIPRA forces took place in 1980 and 1981. In 1983, Mugabe fired Nkomo from his cabinet; triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in [[Matabeleland]] and the [[Midlands, Zimbabwe|Midlands]] in a military crackdown known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'', a Shona term which translates roughly to mean 'the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains'.

-1	Second Boer War	|||	Battle of Bakenlaagte	|||	Two Boer forces fought in this area, one under Botha in the south east and a second under Ben Viljoen in the north east around Lydenburg. Botha's forces were particularly active, raiding railways and British supply convoys, and even mounting a renewed invasion of Natal in September 1901. After defeating British mounted infantry in the [[Battle of Blood River Poort]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]], Botha was forced to withdraw by heavy rains that made movement difficult and crippled his horses. Back on the Transvaal territory around his home district of Vryheid, Botha attacked a British raiding column at [[Battle of Bakenlaagte|Bakenlaagte]], using an effective mounted charge. One of the most active British units was effectively destroyed in this engagement. This made Botha's forces the target of increasingly large and ruthless drives by British forces, in which the British made particular use of native scouts and informers. Eventually, Botha had to abandon the high veld and retreat to a narrow enclave bordering [[Swaziland]].	|||	Third phase: Guerrilla war (September 1900 – May 1902)	|||	Eastern Transvaal	|||

While trying to storm O'Byrne's fortress at [[Glenmalure]] in the heart of the Wicklow mountains, they were ambushed and mauled, losing over 800 men killed. [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] was sent by Grey de Wilton to defend the [[The Pale|Pale]] area of [[Leinster]]. For the remainder of the war, O'Byrne and his allies raided English settlements in the east and south east, but were unable to take strategic advantage of their victory at Glenmalure.	|||	Rebellion in Leinster	|||		|||

The invasion forces were geographically isolated on the tip of the narrow [[Dingle Peninsula]], cut off by [[Mount Brandon]] on one side and the much larger English force on the other. They had no means of escape. In addition, the English had brought up heavy artillery by sea, which rapidly broke down the improvised defences of Dún an Óir.	|||	1580 Papal landing and the Smerwick massacre	|||		|||
-1	Second Italian War of Independence	|||	Battle of Montebello (1859)	|||	The Austrians under Gyulai eventually arrived in [[Vercelli]], menacing [[Turin]], but the Franco-Sardinian move to strengthen [[Alessandria]] and [[Po River]] bridges around [[Casale Monferrato]] forced them to fall back. On May 14, Napoleon III arrived in Alessandria, taking the command of the operations. The initial clash of the war was at [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Montebello]] on 20 May, a battle between an Austrian Corps under Stadion and a single division of the French I Corps under [[Elie Frédéric Forey|Forey]]. The Austrian contingent was three times as large, but the French were victorious, making Gyulai still more cautious. In early June, Gyulai had advanced to the rail center of [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]], leaving his army spread out. Napoleon III attacked the Ticino head on with part of his force while sending another large group of troops to the north to flank the Austrians. The plan worked, causing Gyulai to retreat east to the [[quadrilatero|quadrilateral fortresses]] in Lombardy, where he was relieved of his post as commander.	|||	 The operations 	|||		|||

The Polish king [[John II Casimir]] left [[Warsaw]] the same month to confront the Swedish army in the west, but after some skirmishes with the Swedish vanguard retreated southwards to [[Kraków]].  On 8 September Charles X Gustav occupied Warsaw, then turned south to confront the retreating Polish king. The kings met at the [[Battle of Żarnów]] on 16 September, which like the next encounter at the [[Battle of Wojnicz]] on 3 October was decided for Sweden. John II Casimir was exiled to [[Silesia]] while Kraków surrendered to Charles X Gustav on 19 October.	|||	Swedish campaigns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth	|||		|||

The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalist committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CCP should 'save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing' by the end of 1941.	|||	Conclusion and aftermath	|||	Aftermath	|||

After failing to stop the Japanese in [[Battle of Wuhan|Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with stretched lines of communications deep into the Chinese interior territories, the war had reached a [[stalemate]]. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], which continued to perform sabotage operations against the Japanese using guerrilla warfare tactics. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], and the following day (December 8, 1941) the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China via airlift matériel over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]].

McClellan's [[Army of the Potomac]] continued its retreat toward the safety of [[Harrison's Landing]] on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. Lee's final opportunity to intercept the Union Army was at the [[Battle of Glendale]] on June 30, but poorly executed orders allowed his enemy to escape to a strong defensive position on Malvern Hill.

Over five months 34,000 tons of bombs were dropped. Following the raids, steel production fell by 200,000 tons, making a shortfall of 400,000 tons. Speer acknowledged that the RAF were hitting the right targets, and raids severely disrupted his plans to increase production to meet increasing attritional needs.

In 169 BC, consul Quintus Marcius Philippus crossed the Olympus Range and entered Macedonia. However, his army ran out of provisions and retired on a narrow strip of coast near Tempe. Perseus tried to win Eumenes of Pergamon and King [[Antiochus IV]] of the Seleucid Empire over to his side but failed. He did, however, succeed in buying the support of the [[Illyria]]n king [[Genthius]] in the autumn of 169 BC. Perseus was defeated by the legions of the Roman consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC. This defeat was largely due to the inflexibility of Macedonian phalanx tactics compared to the [[maniple (military unit)|maniple]]-based tactics of the [[Roman legions]].	|||		|||		|||
-1	Trafalgar Campaign	|||	Battle of Trafalgar	|||	The '''Trafalgar Campaign''' was a long and complicated series of fleet manoeuvres carried out by the combined [[French Navy|French]] and [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] fleets; and the opposing moves of the [[Royal Navy]] during much of 1805. These were the culmination of French plans to force a passage through the [[English Channel]], and so achieve a successful [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invasion of the United Kingdom]]. The plans were extremely complicated and proved to be impractical. Much of the detail was due to the personal intervention of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who as a soldier rather than a sailor failed to consider the effects of weather, difficulties in communication, and the Royal Navy. Despite limited successes in achieving some elements of the plan the French commanders were unable to follow the main objective through to execution. The campaign, which took place over thousands of miles of ocean, was marked by several naval engagements, most significantly at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October, where the combined fleet was decisively defeated, and from which the campaign takes its name. A final mopping up action at the [[Battle of Cape Ortegal]] on 4 November completed the destruction of the combined fleet, and secured the supremacy of the Royal Navy at sea.	|||		|||		|||

Yet the English Pragmatic Army did not quickly follow up the attack. Thus, Marshal Noailles had time to block the outlet and had posts all around.

The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods to the south failed completely, but Charles persisted. Eventually, the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6 pm because the fourth and fifth columns had longer marching routes.  The French successfully repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st. Fighting commenced by 3 am on the 22nd, and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon now had 71,000 men and 152 guns on the other side of the river, but the French were still dangerously outnumbered.  Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims. Fighting diminished shortly afterwards, and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau.

Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing [[Peninsular War]], sent another expedition, the [[Walcheren Campaign]], to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict.

In a [[Battle of San Pietro|bloody battle near the village of Crocetta]] on June 29, the Austrians were beaten back, Mercy was killed, and [[Frederick Louis of Württemberg-Winnental|Frederick of Württemberg]], his second, was wounded.  Charles Emmanuel returned the next day to retake command, and resumed his delaying tactics by failing to immediately pursue the retreating Austrians.  The Austrians retreated to the Po, where they were reinforced by additional troops and placed under the command of [[Dominik von Königsegg-Rothenfels|Field Marshal Königsegg]].  After two months of inaction, during which the armies faced each other across the [[Secchia]] River, Königsegg on September 15 took advantage of lax security and executed a raid on Coigny's headquarters at [[Quistello]], very nearly capturing Coigny and taking among other prizes Charles Emmanuel's china.  Two days later the French withdrew to a position near [[Guastalla]] in response to Austrian maneuvers, but one detachment of nearly 3,000 men was surrounded and captured by the advancing Austrians.  On September 19, Königsegg [[Battle of Guastalla|attacked the allied position at Guastalla]], and in another bloody encounter, was beaten back, losing among others Frederick of Württemberg.  Königsegg retreated across the Po, adopting a defensive position between the Po and the [[Oglio]] while Charles Emmanuel again did not capitalize on his victory.

Russian general [[Aleksandr Suvorov]] inflicted a series of defeats on the French in Italy, driving them back to the Alps. However, the allies were less successful in the Netherlands, where the British retreated after a defeat [[Battle of Castricum|at Castricum]], and in Switzerland, where after initial victories a Russian army was completely routed at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]].

The French victories had prevented the Austrians marching to aid Savoy, but as in the Spanish Netherlands the year would prove decisive for the Grand Alliance.

The allied force there held out and were relieved during [[Operation Crusader]], who then pushed the Axis forces back to where they had started by the end of the year.  In 1942 Axis forces drove the Allies back [[Battle of Gazala|capturing Tobruk]] but failed to gain a decisive victory. On the final Axis push to Egypt the Allies retreated to El Alamein, where at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] the Eighth Army defeated the Axis forces, which never recovered and were driven out of Libya to [[Tunisia]], where they were defeated in the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. After the British defeats in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]], the Western Desert Campaign had become more important to British strategy. For [[Adolf Hitler]] the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] dwarfed the desert war, which was a holding action of secondary importance. The Axis never had sufficient resources or the means to deliver them to defeat the British, who in their turn missed several opportunities to finish the campaign, by diverting resources to Greece and the Levant in 1941 and the Far East in 1942.	|||		|||		|||

The battle had the original aim of capturing the ridges east of Ypres then advancing to Roulers and Thourout to close the main rail line supplying the German garrisons of the Western front and the Belgian coast then capturing the German submarine bases on the Belgian coast, but was later restricted to advancing the British Army onto the ridges around Ypres, as the unusually wet weather slowed British progress. Canadian veterans from the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Hill 70]] relieved the two [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC Corps]] and other British forces and took the village of Passchendaele on 6 November, despite extremely heavy rain and casualties. The offensive produced large numbers of casualties on both sides for relatively little gain of ground against dogged German resistance, yet that captured was of great tactical importance and the British made inexorable gains during periods of drier weather. The ground was generally muddy and pocked by shell craters, making supply missions and further advancement very difficult.	|||	 1917—British offensives 	|||	 British offensives, American troops arrive 	|||

At 14:00 the march set off towards the [[Brandenburg Gate]] (Brandenburger Tor), arriving to a police barrier at the [[Pariser Platz]] square at about 15:00. The march thus made a detour around Brandenburger Tor and marched towards the Kanzleramt, the seat of the federal government of Germany. In front of the Kanzleramt, an open microphone was put in place where anybody could come up and give their thoughts. The sound system was not loud enough for such a big gathering and so it was proposed to use the [[human microphone]] (das menschliche Megaphone in German) technique of Occupy Wall Street. The plan had been for everyone to go to Mariannenplatz in the evening where stages, music and food had been prepared. However the people spontaneously decided to assemble in front of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] and held an assembly there. Tents were put out, and the food was brought from Mariannenplatz. The police came and told the people to disperse. The people refused to disperse and continued their assembly using the human mic. The police then proceeded to destroy the tents which had been put up. After all the tents had been destroyed or confiscated by the police, the police made rounds around the assembly and stole the blankets and mats of the people. At around midnight the policed made a final call to disperse and threatened serious consequences for those who stayed. The people decided to stay. The police then proceeded to violently and forcibly remove the peaceful gathering of people in the park in front of the parliamentarian. The police then told the dislodged people on the streets around Platz der Republik to go to Brandenburgertor. More than 100 people then regrouped at Pariserplatz near Brandenburgertor to make a new assembly. In that assembly it was decided to come back the next day at 13:00 at Pariserplatz to continue the movement. As soon had this decision been made that the police made renewed threats to the people. The people then decided to leave for the moment and come back the next day.

This strategy, called Plan Dalet, was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April.  1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and [[Palmach]]'s Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]], under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalization of the city, and secure it as part of the Jewish state.  The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Hasayni in combat. During this time, and independently of Haganah or the framework of Plan Dalet, irregular fighters from [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] formations massacred a substantial number of Arabs at [[Deir Yassin massacre|Deir Yassin]], an event that, though publicly deplored and criticized by the principal Jewish authorities, had a deep impact on the morale of the Arab population and contributed to generate the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|exode of the Arab population]].	|||	Background	|||		|||

The army plotters and their civilian allies became convinced that Hitler should be assassinated, so that a government acceptable to the western Allies could be formed, and a separate peace negotiated in time to prevent a Soviet invasion of Germany. In August 1943 Tresckow met, for the first time, a young staff officer named Lieutenant Colonel [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]]. Badly wounded in North Africa, Claus von Stauffenberg was a political conservative, a zealous German nationalist, and a Roman Catholic. From early 1942, he had come to share two basic convictions with many military officers: that Germany was being led to disaster, and that Hitler's removal from power was necessary. After the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in December 1942, despite his religious scruples, he concluded that the Führer's assassination was a lesser moral evil than Hitler's remaining in power.  Stauffenberg brought a new tone of decisiveness to the ranks of the resistance movement. When Tresckow was assigned to the Eastern Front, Stauffenberg took charge of planning and executing the assassination attempt.	|||	Planning a coup	|||	Von Stauffenberg joins the conspirators	|||

From June 1944 until January 1945, B-29s stationed in India staged through bases in China to make a series of raids on Japan, but this effort proved unsuccessful. The strategic bombing campaign was greatly expanded from November 1944 when bases in the [[Mariana Islands]] became available as a result of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana Islands Campaign]]. These attacks initially attempted to target industrial facilities, but from March 1945 were generally directed against urban areas as much of the manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes. Aircraft flying from Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s and the [[Ryukyu Islands]] also frequently struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for the [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion of Japan]] scheduled for October 1945.

0	Allemand's expedition of 1805	|||	Battle of Trafalgar	|||	On 25 September, Allemand achieved a major success when his squadron, while waiting for a convoy from the [[Leeward Islands]], encountered a seven ship convoy from the island of [[Saint Helena]]. The convoy's commander, Captain [[Daniel Woodriff]] in the [[fourth rate]] {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}, sought to interpose his ship between the French squadron and his convoy and was captured after a fierce battle. All except one of convoy escaped, and by deliberately drawing the French away from his own convoy's direction, he had saved the Leewards Islands convoy from attack as well. After the battle, Allemand was forced to conduct repairs at [[Tenerife]], sailing again on 17 October, four days before the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. With the planned invasion impossible, Allemand began commerce raiding in the Eastern Atlantic, capturing 43 merchant ships during his cruise and successfully disrupting the British blockade of Cadiz. This had an unintended but significant effect on the [[Atlantic campaign of 1806]], resulting eventually in the [[Battle of San Domingo]] in February 1806. Allemand returned to Rochefort on 23 December, having not lost a single ship during the expedition.	|||		|||		|||

To the Axis, this was viewed as a success. More importantly in late July ''[[25 Luglio|a coup]]'' deposed Benito Mussolini as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that could be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the [[Battle of Berlin|fall of Berlin]]. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief, [[Albert Kesselring]].	|||	Background	|||	Allied plan	|||

0	Arab–Byzantine wars	|||	Second Fitna	|||	The setback at Constantinople was followed by further reverses across the huge Muslim empire. As Gibbon writes, 'this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the universal defection of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic.' His forces were directed at putting down rebellions, and in one such battle he was surrounded by insurgents and killed. Then, the third governor of Africa, Zuheir, was overthrown by a powerful army, sent from Constantinople by [[Constantine IV]] for the relief of [[Carthage]].  Meanwhile, a [[Second Fitna|second Arab civil war]] was raging in [[Arabia]] and Syria resulting in a series of four caliphs between the death of Muawiyah in 680 and the ascension of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 685, and was ongoing until 692 with the death of the rebel leader.	|||	The Muslim conquests, 634–718	|||	Arab attacks on Anatolia and sieges of Constantinople	|||	 Attacks against Byzantine holdings in Africa, Sicily and the East

0	Ardeatine massacre	|||	Allied invasion of Sicily	|||	In August 1943, Rome was bombed again, and the Badoglio government began secret surrender negotiations with the Allies in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]], although still outwardly allied to Germany. In accordance with the Pope's wishes, the Italian government also unilaterally declared Rome an [[Open City]], i.e., a demilitarized zone, a declaration the Allies would refuse to recognize and the Germans to respect. The Germans, anticipating an Italian defection, meanwhile began moving more and more troops into Italy ([[Operation Achse]]). Foreseeing a German invasion, a coalition of Anti-Fascist parties and Monarchists formed the [[Italian Resistance Movement|Committee of National Liberation]] (CLN). On 3 September the Badoglio government signed an unconditional surrender, which U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] made public on the eve of the [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]]'s amphibious landing at [[Operation Avalanche|Salerno]] (8 September). At the same time, Badoglio issued the [[Badoglio Proclamation]], directing Italian troops to end hostilities against the Allies but to oppose attacks 'from any other quarter'.	|||	Historical background	|||		|||
0	Argentine Civil Wars	|||	Battle of Caseros	|||	Since the fall of Rivadavia and the lack of a proper head of state there was a dynamic whereby leaders (''[[caudillo]]s'') from the hinterland provinces would delegate certain powers, such as foreign debt payment or the management of [[Foreign relations of Argentina|international relations]] to the Buenos Aires leader. In addition, Rosas was granted the [[sum of public power]]. These powers also enabled Rosas to participate in the protracted [[Uruguayan Civil War]] in favor of [[Manuel Oribe]], though unsuccessfully; Oribe, in turn, led numerous military campaigns on behalf of Rosas, and became an invaluable ally in the struggle against Lavalle and other Unitarians. The [[Argentine Confederation]] thus functioned, albeit amid ongoing conflicts, until the 1852 [[Battle of Caseros]], when Rosas was deposed and exiled.	|||	Overview	|||	Rosas and the Unitarians	|||

Trenches and shell holes filled with water, which made infantry movement exceedingly difficult and exhausted trench garrisons. The British and French found it impossible to arrange co-ordinated attacks and fought many small piecemeal actions, rather than general attacks until 15 September. British-French co-operation broke down again and the French did not attack on 15 September, when the British captured the wood during the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] {{nowrap|(15–22 September).}} The German defenders had great difficulty finding fresh troops for the Somme front, despite ending the [[Battle of Verdun]] {{nowrap|(21 February – 20 December)}} and had to send divisions to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and to [[Romania|Rumania]] after it declared war on 27 August. Turnover of German divisions was high and many had to be withdrawn and replaced after fourteen days in the front line. The Germans lacked the resources to make many big organised counter-attacks and those at High Wood and the vicinity were often as costly and ineffective, as corresponding British attacks.	|||		|||		|||

The [[Australian 2nd Division|2nd Australian Division]] occupied the Butte on 24 February 1917, during the German retirements made on the Somme front, preparatory to [[Alberich (World War I German operation)|Operation Alberich]], the retreat to the [[Hindenburg Line]]. The Butte de Warlencourt was recaptured by the German 2nd Army on 24 March 1918, during the retreat of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]] in [[Operation Michael]], the German spring offensive. The butte was recaptured for the last time on 26 August, by the [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]], during the [[Second Battle of Bapaume]].

Soviet attempts to regain the island resulted in battles which continued over the ice until April 1942. Finnish and German forces also captured lightly defended [[Bolshoy Tyuters|Tytärsaari]]. In July 1942, the Soviets attempted to wrest the small island of [[Battle of Someri|Someri]] from the Finnish.

0	Battle for Caen	|||	Battle of Merville Gun Battery	|||	On 6 June 1944, Allied forces invaded France by launching [[Operation Neptune]], the beach landing operation of [[Operation Overlord]]. A force of several thousand ships assaulted the beaches in Normandy, supported by {{Circa|3,000 aircraft.}} The D-Day landings were successful, but the Allied forces were unable to take Caen as planned. The Allies also employed [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]]. The American [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division]]s, as well as the British [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] (with the attached [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion]]), were inserted behind the enemy lines. The British and Canadian paratroopers behind Sword Beach were tasked in [[Operation Tonga]] with reaching and occupying the strategically important bridges such as Horsa and [[Pegasus Bridge|Pegasus]], as well as to take the artillery battery at [[Battle of Merville Gun Battery|Merville]] in order to hinder the forward progress of the German forces. They managed to establish a bridgehead north of Caen, on the east bank of the Orne, that the Allied troops could use to their advantage in the battle for Caen. The first operation intended to capture Caen was the initial landings on [[Sword Beach]] by the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd British Infantry Division]] on 6 June. Despite being able to penetrate the [[Atlantic Wall]] and push south the division was unable to reach the city, their final objectives according to the plan, and in fact fell short by {{convert|3.7|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

The Allies aimed to take [[Caen]], one of the largest cities in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. Caen was an important Allied objective because it lay astride the [[Orne River]] and [[Canal de Caen à la Mer|Caen Canal]]; these two water obstacles could strengthen a German defensive position if not crossed. Caen was a road hub and the side which held it could shift forces rapidly. The area around Caen was open, compared to the [[bocage]] country in the west of Normandy and was valuable land for airfields.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle for Caen	|||	Operation Cobra	|||	On D-Day, 6 June 1944, Caen was an objective for the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd British Infantry Division]] and remained the focal point for a series of battles throughout June, July and into August. The battle did not go as planned for the Allies, instead dragging on for two months, because German forces devoted most of their reserves to holding Caen, particularly their armoured divisions. As a result, German forces facing the American invasion thrust further west were spread thin, relying on the rough terrain of the back country to slow down the American advance up to [[Operation Cobra]]. With so many German divisions held up defending Caen, the American forces were eventually able to break through to the south and east, threatening to encircle the German forces in Normandy from behind. The old city of Caen—with many buildings dating back to the [[Middle Ages]]—was destroyed by Allied bombing and the fighting. The reconstruction of Caen lasted until 1962; today, little of the pre-war city remains.	|||		|||		|||

(Unopposed assaults took place on 9 April 1940 against Masnedøfortet and Aalborg airport, Denmark.) It took place on 10 May 1940 as part of the [[Battle of the Netherlands]] between the [[Royal Netherlands Army]] and ''Luftwaffe'' ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratroops). German paratroopers dropped in and around [[The Hague]] in order to capture Dutch airfields and the city. After taking the city, the plan was to force the [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] to surrender and to thus defeat the Kingdom of the Netherlands within a single day. The operation failed to capture the Queen, and the German forces failed to hold on to the airfields after Dutch counterattacks. The main body of surviving troops under [[Hans Graf von Sponeck|Von Sponeck]] retreated toward the nearby dunes where they were continually pursued and harassed by Dutch troops until the Dutch supreme command, due to major setbacks on other fronts, surrendered five days later.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle in Berlin	|||	Reichstag fire	|||	At 06:00 on 30 April the [[150th Rifle Division]] had still not captured the upper floors of the Ministry of the Interior, but while the fighting was still going on, the 150th launched an attack from there across the 400 metres of [[Königsplatz, Berlin|Königsplatz]] towards the ''Reichstag''. For the Soviets, the ''Reichstag'' was the symbol of the Third Reich (ironically, it was never restored by the Nazis after the [[Reichstag fire|fire]]); but it was of such significant value that the Soviets wanted to capture it before the [[May Day]] parade in Moscow. The assault was not an easy one. The Germans had dug a complicated network of trenches around the building and a collapsed tunnel had filled with water from the Spree forming a moat across Königsplatz. The initial infantry assault was decimated by cross fire from the ''Reichstag'' and the [[Kroll Opera House]] on the western side of Königsplatz. By now the Spree had been bridged and the Soviets were able to bring up tanks and artillery to support fresh assaults by the infantry, some of which were tasked with out-flanking the Opera House and attacking it from the north-west. By 10:00 the soldiers of the 150th had reached the moat, but accurate fire from [[12.8 cm FlaK 40|12.8 cm guns]], two kilometres away on the [[Berlin Zoo]] [[Zoo flak tower|flak tower]], prevented any further successful advance across the moat during daylight. Throughout the rest of the day, as ninety artillery pieces, some as large as the 203 mm howitzer, as well as ''Katyusha'' rocket launchers, bombarded the ''Reichstag'' and its defensive trenches. Colonel [[A. P. Negoda|Negoda's]] 171st Rifle Division, on the left flank of the 150th, continued to capture the buildings of the diplomatic quarter to the north of Königsplatz.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=354–355}}	|||	Battle	|||	 Centre 	|||	 Battle for the Reichstag

Acting on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s orders, in early 1811 [[Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] led a French expedition from [[Andalusia]] into [[Extremadura]] in a bid to draw Allied forces away from the Lines and ease Masséna's plight. Napoleon's information was outdated and Soult's intervention came too late; starving and understrength, Masséna's army was already withdrawing to Spain. Soult was able to capture the strategically important fortress at Badajoz on the border between Spain and Portugal  from the Spanish, but was forced to return to Andalusia following [[Claude Victor-Perrin, duc de Belluno|Marshal Victor]]'s defeat in March at the [[Battle of Barrosa]]. However, Soult left Badajoz strongly garrisoned. In April, following news of Masséna's complete withdrawal from Portugal, Wellington sent a powerful [[Anglo-Portuguese Army|Anglo-Portuguese corps]] commanded by [[William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|Sir William Beresford]] to retake the border town. The Allies drove most of the French from the surrounding area and began the [[Second Siege of Badajoz (1811)|Siege of Badajoz]].	|||		|||		|||

Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura arrived in the vicinity with some 15,000 troops under the command of General [[Gabriel Mendizabal|Mendizabal]]. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Gebora]] the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

There was a lull as the French armies paused to capture a number of fortresses held by the Coalition. Then, as [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]]'s ''[[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]]'' prepared to overrun the [[Dutch Republic]], Jourdan's ''[[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]]'' turned northeast to drive the Austrians back to the Rhine, first winning the [[Battle of Sprimont]] in September. On 2 October, Jourdan launched attacks at Düren on the right, Aldenhoven and [[Jülich]] on the right center, [[Linnich]] on the left center and Ratheim on the left.

He was made Caesar's second in command, as [[Master of the Horse]], and was left in charge in Italy during much of the civil war. In 44 BC he was elected as Caesar's consular colleague. After Caesar's murder, Antony pursued Caesar's assassins and vied for supreme power with [[Augustus|Octavian]] (later to become [[Caesar Augustus]]), first forming an alliance with Octavian and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] in the [[Second Triumvirate]], then being defeated by him at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC.

Allied forces advanced over {{convert|11|km|0}} on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]]'s [[British Fourth Army]] playing the decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large number of [[surrender (military)|surrendering]] [[German Empire|German]] forces.

Operation ''Michael'' was intended to defeat the right wing of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], but a lack of success before [[Arras, France|Arras]] ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of [[Amiens]], a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at [[First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]] by British and Australian troops on 4 April.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||

This battle took place immediately after the Austrian surrender in the [[Ulm Campaign]]. Following the surrender of [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]] in the [[Battle of Ulm]], the Russian forces led by [[Kutuzov]] decided to retreat along the Danube to regroup with other Russian troops. [[Napoleon]] was determined to pin down the Russian army and sent Joachim Murat and Jean Lannes to intercept the retreating Russian army.	|||	Background	|||		|||

Lee's]] Army of Northern Virginia from their defenses at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg, Virginia]] after the [[Battle of Five Forks]], [[Third Battle of Petersburg]] and [[Battle of Sutherland's Station]], the Union Army closely pursued the Confederates westward on parallel and trailing routes. The Confederates, short of rations and supplies, suffered numerous losses from desertion, straggling and battle, especially the [[Battle of Sailor's Creek]] on April 6, 1865. After the [[Battle of Cumberland Church]] on April 7, Lee's army made a third consecutive night march in an effort to stay ahead of the Union forces. Union cavalry under the command of Major General [[Philip H. Sheridan]] made a long ride of about {{convert|30|mi|km}} on April 8, 1865 in order to capture Confederate supply trains at Appomattox Station and get ahead of the Confederates, cutting off their routes of retreat.	|||		|||		|||

The defeat at Arklow marked the third failure to extend the fight for Irish independence beyond the borders of County Wexford following the other bloody repulses at [[Battle of New Ross 1798|New Ross]] and [[Battle of Bunclody|Bunclody]]. The Irish strategy now changed to a policy of static defence against the encroaching British armies.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

0	Battle of Ballinamuck	|||	Battle of Castlebar	|||	The victory of [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]] at the [[Battle of Castlebar]], despite gaining him around 5,000 extra Irish recruits, had not led to a renewed outbreak of the rebellion in other areas as hoped; the defeat of the earlier revolt had devastated the Irish republican movement to the extent that few were willing to renew the struggle. A massive British army of some 26,000 men was assembled under the new [[Viceroy]] [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and was steadily moving west. Abandoning Castlebar, [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|Humbert]] moved towards [[Ulster]] with the apparent intention of igniting a rising there but after defeating a blocking force of British troops at [[Collooney]] in [[County Sligo|Sligo]] he altered course following reports that rebellions had broken out in [[Westmeath]] and [[Longford]].	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

Charles replaced him with his supporter [[Renaud d'Herbauges|Renaud, Count of Herbauge]]. While Nominoë was ill, Renaud attacked Breton territory, but was killed in battle by the Bretons led by [[Erispoe]], Nominoë's son, in alliance with Lambert. This allowed Lambert to occupy Nantes with the support of Nominoë. Recovered from his illness, Nominoë hoped to take advantage of the disorder to expand into Frankish territory.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Bardia	|||	Dunkirk evacuation	|||	Italy's position in the centre of the Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements and supplies for the area had to travel around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. For this reason, it was more convenient to reinforce [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Sir Archibald Wavell]]'s [[Middle East Command]] with troops from Australia, New Zealand and [[British Raj|India]]. Nonetheless, even when Britain was [[Operation Sealion|threatened with invasion]] after the [[Battle of France]] and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] after its losses in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], troops and supplies were still despatched to the Middle East Command.

In January 1942, forces of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] invaded [[Luzon]] along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor]]. The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the [[Bataan]] Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The [[Bataan]] peninsula and the island of [[Corregidor]] were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region. Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino (many were U.S. Nationals) and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward. As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prohibited immediate victory across the Pacific. The surrender at Bataan was the largest in [[Military history of the United States|American]] and [[Military history of the Philippines|Filipino military histories]], and was the largest United States surrender since the [[American Civil War]]'s [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Battle of Harper's Ferry]].	|||		|||		|||

Dismissed beforehand by a [[France|French]] commander as 'an attack organized for [[amateur]]s by amateurs', it turned out to be 'hugely successful' for the British, in contrast to the disaster of the [[First day on the Somme]] on 1 July.

Field Marshal von Diebitsch initially planned a full frontal assault on Warsaw to take place on February 26. The successful Polish counter-attack at Białołęka, however, prompted von Diebitsch to change his plans and attack earlier.

Its goal, the encirclement and destruction of the [[Red Army]]'s [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] forces around [[Minsk]], was accomplished. All major Soviet counter-attacks and break-through attempts failed and the defenders were defeated, allowing for the [[Wehrmacht]] to take many Soviet prisoners  and to further advance into the Soviet Union at a pace so swift that some believed the Germans had effectively won the war against the Soviet Union already.	|||		|||		|||

This gave Japan land access to the Chinese mainland where it had long been engaged in military intervention and, since 1937, had been fighting a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|full-on war of invasion]] against the temporarily allied forces of the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. It also gave Imperial Japan a seaboard facing Sarawak and North Borneo across the China Sea. Japan turned its eyes from the war in China and towards strategic targets in the Pacific and the Dutch East Indies.

By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of [[Western Europe]]. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and that there would be a Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.	|||	Aftermath	|||	Hitler's reaction and Strategic overview	|||

This battle demonstrated that the country's rulers were powerless to stop the British invasion but that a group of civilians could succeed in driving back the British. These stories and rumors led Chinese civilians to believe that local armies and militias would be the only successful way to drive out the British and nurtured a general climate of dissatisfaction, which helped pave the way for the [[Taiping Rebellion|massive rebellions]] and [[Boxer Rebellion|anti-foreigner movements]] that came to plague the Qing authorities later on.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

Carleton]] ordered Carson into the Navajo stronghold in [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]]. The canyon had been explored once before in 1858 by Colonel [[Dixon S. Miles]].

When Lángara saw the size of the British fleet, he attempted to make for the safety of [[Cádiz]], but the copper-sheathed British ships chased his fleet down. In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish ships, including Lángara's flagship. Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of Cedar Creek	|||	Battle of Gettysburg	|||	Fortunately for Sheridan, Early's men were too occupied to take notice of the Union general's dramatic arrival; they were hungry and exhausted and fell out of their ranks to pillage supplies from the Union camps. By 10 a.m., Jubal Early had developed a stunning Confederate victory, capturing 1,300 Union prisoners, 24 cannons, and driving seven infantry divisions off the field with a smaller force. But rather than exploiting his victory, Early ordered a halt in his offensive to reorganize, a decision for which he later received criticism from his surviving subordinates. John B. Gordon wrote years later, 'My heart went into my boots. Visions of the fatal halt on the first day at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], and of the whole day's hesitation to permit an assault on Grant's exposed flank on the 6th of May in [[Battle of the Wilderness|The Wilderness]] rose before me.' Early wrote to Robert E. Lee, 'So many of our men had stopped in the camp to plunder (in which I am sorry to say that officers participated), the country was so open, and the enemy's cavalry so strong, that I did not deem it prudent to press further, especially as Lomax had not come up.' The two armies stood about a mile apart in lines perpendicular to the Valley Pike. At 1 p.m. Early gave a halfhearted order to Gordon to attack the Union line, but 'not if he found the enemy's line too strong to attack with success.' Gordon's division moved forward against the XIX Corps, with Kershaw and Ramseur ready to support them, but after firing a heavy volley into the Union line, they withdrew.	|||	Battle	|||	The 'fatal halt'	|||

That same day, Sedgwick advanced across the Rappahannock River, defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]] and by May 4 had driven back Sedgwick's men to Banks's Ford, surrounding them on three sides.

A smaller version of the house was rebuilt using some of the original materials, which served as a landmark for many of the veteran reunions of the late 19th century. In 1927, the rebuilt house was destroyed by fire. That same year, the [[United States Congress]] authorized the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]], which preserves some of the land that saw fighting in the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], the Chancellorsville Campaign, the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], and the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] (the latter two being key battles in the 1864 [[Overland Campaign]]).	|||	Aftermath	|||	Battlefield preservation	|||

In the first two years of the war, four major attempts had failed: the first foundered just miles away from [[Washington, D.C.]], at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Manassas) in July 1861. Maj. Gen. [[George B.

In December 1862, Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] commanded the Army of the Potomac and attempted to reach Richmond by way of [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].

But the campaign had served Grant's purpose&amp;mdash;as ill-advised as his attack on Cold Harbor was, Lee had lost the initiative and was forced to devote his attention to the defense of Richmond and Petersburg. He beat Grant to Petersburg, barely, but spent the remainder of the war (save its final week) defending Richmond behind a fortified trench line. Although Southerners realized their situation was desperate, they hoped that Lee's stubborn (and bloody) resistance would have political repercussions by causing [[Abraham Lincoln]] to lose the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]] to a more peace-friendly candidate.

The [[Battle of Aachen]] was part of the [[Drive to the Siegfried Line]]. The hill was named after a large [[crucifix]] mounted on the top of the hill. The objective of the battle was to gain control of the hill, which was laced with a maze of [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]] and [[bunker]]s, so that the main objective of encircling Aachen could be completed.

He did this twice more to two other pillboxes, each time successfully destroying the pillbox; only on the third one was he wounded by a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round. Although he was wounded, he refused medical attention and continued up the hill. After the hill was secure, he went by himself on a  [[reconnaissance]] mission to locate enemy troops beyond the hill. He deliberately drew the enemy fire to find out where enemy emplacements were. While doing this, he was wounded twice more.

General Giap even laid claim to such a strategy in an announcement in September, but, to the Americans, it all seemed a bit too contrived. Yet, no understandable analysis seemed to explain Hanoi's almost suicidal military actions. They could only be explained if a situation akin to Dien Bien Phu came into being.

0	Battle of Delium	|||	Battle of Leuctra	|||	In addition to showing an innovative use of a new technology, Pagondas made use of planned tactical warfare for one of the first times in recorded history. In the previous centuries, battles between Greek city states were relatively simple encounters between massed formations of hoplites, where cavalry played no important role and all depended on the unity and force of the massed ranks of the infantry, straining against the opponent. At Delium, Pagondas made use of deeper ranks, reserves, cavalry interventions, light-armed skirmishers (peltasts) and gradual changes in tactics during the battle. These novelties were to be later exploited in more famous actions of Theban troops in the following century, led by [[Epaminondas]] in the [[Battle of Leuctra]] and others.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

Although several [[Trafalgar Campaign|naval battles]] determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was decided on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations in the Danube valley: the [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm campaign]] in the upper Danube, and the [[Battle of Austerlitz|Vienna campaign]], in the middle Danube valley.	|||	Danube campaign	|||		|||
0	Battle of Dürenstein	|||	War of the Austrian Succession	|||	Until 1805, Dürenstein was probably best known as the village in which [[Third Crusade|crusader]] [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was held by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V, Duke of Austria]]. In 1741, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies, intent on capturing Vienna, by painting drain pipes to look like cannons, and beating on drums, thus suggesting the presence of a large force.	|||	Battlefield commemorations	|||		|||
0	Battle of El Mazuco	|||	War in the North	|||	The '''Battle of El Mazuco''' was fought between 6 and 22 September 1937, between the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] and [[Spanish State|Nationalist]] armies during the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a part of the [[War in the North]] campaign. The Republican defence of [[El Mazuco]] and the surrounding mountains halted the Nationalist advance into eastern [[Asturias Offensive|Asturias]], despite their forces being outnumbered sevenfold. After weeks of intense fighting over extreme terrain the defenders were eventually overwhelmed, and the Nationalists were then able to link up with their forces advancing from [[Leon (province)|León]], leading to the fall of [[Gijon|Gijón]] and the abandonment of Asturias, the last Republican province in North-West Spain.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of El Pla	|||	Siege of Tortosa (1810)	|||	The [[Siege of Tortosa (1810)|Siege of Tortosa]] ended on 2 January 1811 when the Spanish garrison surrendered to [[Louis Gabriel Suchet]]'s [[III Corps (Grande Armée)|III Corps]]. During the siege, [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jacques MacDonald]]'s [[VII Corps (Grande Armée)|VII Corps]] blocked the Catalan army of [[Luis González Torres de Navarra, Marquess of Campoverde]] from interfering with Suchet's operations. With the siege finished, MacDonald moved toward [[Lleida|Lleida (Lérida)]] with 12,000 troops. After reaching Valls, his vanguard commander Francesco Orsatelli (called Eugenio) heard that an enemy force was nearby and determined to attack it. Eugenio was mortally wounded and his brigade driven back by Sarsfeld's men. After Giuseppe Federico Palombini's brigade joined Eugenio's survivors, Sarsfield counterattacked and defeated both Italian units. Only the intervention of a handful of French cavalry led by [[Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort]] prevented a complete disaster. After the day's action, MacDonald found that Campoverde's main force was coming up behind him. During the night, the French marshal force-marched his troops north to [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]] on the road to Llieda, conceding the battlefield to the Spanish.	|||		|||		|||

During a [[Battle of Lanzerath Ridge|20-hour-long battle]], the18 man platoon, led by a 20-year old lieutenant [[Lyle Bouck|Lyle Bouck Jr.]], inflicted 93 casualties on the Germans. The U.S. troops seriously disrupted the entire German [[6th Panzer Army|German Sixth Panzer Army]] schedule of attack along the northern edge of the offensive.	|||	 Kampfgruppe Peiper advance 	|||	 Battle of Lanzerath Ridge 	|||
0	Battle of Fontenoy	|||	Battle of Pfaffenhofen	|||	Elsewhere, the Pragmatic Allies had scored considerable success in late 1744. A joint Austro-Saxon force under Charles of Lorraine and Count [[Otto Ferdinand von Abensberg und Traun|Traun]] drove [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]'s Prussian army from [[Bohemia]]; and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] had expelled the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] from northern Italy. Further success followed with the death in January 1745 of the French [[Puppet#Non-puppetry related usages of the word|puppet]], Emperor [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]]. When his successor, [[Maximilian III Joseph]], hesitated over peace proposals, the Austrians launched a rapid campaign, culminating in April with the Franco-Bavarian defeat at the decisive [[Battle of Pfaffenhofen]]. Max Joseph sued for peace and gave his support for the candidacy of [[Maria Theresa]]'s husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], in the coming Imperial election for the vacant throne.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Fort Dipitie	|||	Boxer Rebellion	|||	The Cacos followed up their ambush and attacked the Marines again.  All night long, the Americans held their ground.  (Cacos were reputed to be poor marksmen and, indeed, only one Marine was wounded in the battle; altogether, about 75 Haitians were killed in the two-day battle.)  Later that night, [[Boxer Rebellion]] veteran and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Dan Daly]] retrieved the machine gun and killed three Haitians with his knife, earning himself his second Medal of Honor.  ([[First Lieutenant]] [[Edward Albert Ostermann]] commanded one of the squads; he, too, was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroic action in this engagement.)	|||	Battle	|||		|||
0	Battle of Fort Donelson	|||	Battle of Belmont	|||	Floyd's Confederate force of approximately 17,000 men consisted of three divisions, garrison troops, and attached cavalry. The three divisions were commanded by Floyd (replaced by Colonel [[Gabriel C. Wharton]] when Floyd took command of the entire force) and Brig. Gens. [[Bushrod Johnson]] and [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon Bolivar Buckner]]. During the battle, Johnson, the engineering officer who briefly commanded Fort Donelson in late January, was effectively superseded by Brig. Gen. [[Gideon Pillow|Gideon J. Pillow]] (Grant's opponent at his first battle at [[Battle of Belmont|Belmont]]). Pillow, who arrived at Fort Donelson on February 9, was displaced from overall command of the fort when the more-senior Floyd arrived.	|||	Opposing forces	|||	Confederate	|||
0	Battle of Fort Donelson	|||	First Battle of Bull Run	|||	Johnston wanted to give command of Fort Donelson to Beauregard, who had performed ably at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], but the latter declined because of a throat ailment. Instead, the responsibility went to Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], who had just arrived following an unsuccessful assignment under [[Robert E. Lee]] in western [[Virginia]]. Floyd was a wanted man in the North for alleged graft and [[secession]]ist activities when he was [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] in the [[James Buchanan]] administration. Floyd's background was political, not military, but he was nevertheless the senior brigadier general on the Cumberland River.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Fort Henry	|||	War of 1812	|||	The fort was designed to stop traffic on the river, not to withstand large-scale infantry assaults that armies would use during the war. Construction began in mid-June, using men from the 10th Tennessee Infantry and [[slavery|slaves]]. The first cannon was test fired on July 12, 1861. After this flurry of activity, the remainder of 1861 saw little action because forts on the Mississippi River had a higher priority for receiving men and artillery. General Polk also neglected Forts Henry and Donelson in favor of defending Columbus, Kentucky. In late December, additional men from the 27th Alabama Infantry arrived along with 500 slaves to construct a small fortification across the river on Stewart's Hill, within artillery range of Fort Henry, and named it Fort Heiman. In January 1862, Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]] assumed command of both Forts Henry and Donelson, with a combined force of 4,900 men. At Fort Henry, approximately 3,000-3,400 men in two brigades were commanded by Colonels Adolphus Heiman and [[Joseph Drake (soldier)|Joseph Drake]]. The men were armed primarily with antique flintlock rifles from the [[War of 1812]].	|||	Fort Henry	|||		|||
0	Battle of Fort McAllister (1864)	|||	Battle of Shiloh	|||	Sherman was overjoyed with the victory and rowed down the Ogeechee to view the fort.  That evening at Gen. Hazen's Head Quarters, Lt. Col Strong, General Sherman and Gen. Hazen had supper with Major Anderson, commander of the now defeated fortification who was confined there. The next day he rowed out to Dahlgren's flagship to greet the admiral.  Sherman also had reason to be proud of the troops that had taken part in the victory at Fort McAllister.  These were the same troops he personally led as a division commander at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] and a corps commander at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]].	|||	Battle	|||		|||
0	Battle of Fort Rivière	|||	Battle of Fort Dipitie	|||	When the three men exited the tunnel on the other side of the wall, they opened fire with their weapons on 60-75 rebels. Once the first wave of marines entered the stronghold, the rest of the marines and sailors attacked. Combat lasted for 10-15 minutes before the Cacos fled. Over 51 were killed and none were taken prisoner. Over 20 of the rebels were killed when they fled the fort by jumping over the [[parapet]] under heavy fire. Like at the [[Battle of Fort Dipitie]], Smedley defeated a superior enemy force with a loss of only one man wounded. The casualty was wounded by a rock when a Caco struck him in the face with it, knocking out two of the U.S. Marine [[lieutenant]]'s teeth. The Cacos, not knowing what the gunsight was used for, typically threw down their weapons and armed themselves with stones when closely encountered by U.S. Marines.	|||	Battle	|||		|||
0	Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip	|||	Siege of Vicksburg	|||	Forts Jackson and St. Philip had been the shell of the Confederate defenses on the lower Mississippi, and nothing now stood between the Gulf and Memphis. After a few days spent repairing battle damage his ships had suffered, Farragut sent expeditions north to demand the surrender of other cities on the river. With no effective means of defense, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] complied. At [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], however, the guns of the ships could not reach the Confederate fortifications atop the bluffs, and the small army contingent that was with them could not force the issue. Farragut settled into a siege, but was forced to withdraw when falling levels of the river threatened to strand his deep-water ships. [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] would not fall until another year had passed.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Battle of France	|||	Schlieffen Plan	|||	On 10 October 1939, the British refused Hitler's offer of peace; on 12 October, the French did the same. Franz Halder presented the first plan for ''Fall Gelb'' ('Case Yellow') on 19 October. This was the pre-war codename of plans for a campaign in the Low Countries: the ''Aufmarschanweisung N°1, Fall Gelb'' ('Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow'). Halder's plan has often been compared to the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which the Germans attempted to execute in 1914 in the opening phase of the [[World War I|First World War]].	|||	German strategy	|||	Similarity to Schlieffen Plan	|||

[[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]'s [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] advanced on a more northerly route while Moreau's [[Army of Rhin-et-Moselle]] took a more southerly path. Opposing them were [[Wilhelm von Wartensleben]]'s Army of the Lower Rhine and Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine, both under the overall direction of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]].

The Eighth Army advance of {{convert|800|km|mi}} over-stretched its means of supply and in January 1942, the British reduced the front line garrison, to work on lines of communication and supply dumps, preparatory to another westwards advance against [[Tripolitania]]. The elimination of [[Force K]] from Malta, which ran into an Italian minefield off Tripoli in mid-December and the arrival of Fliegerkorps II in Sicily, neutralised the air and naval forces in Malta and more Axis supplies reached Libya.	|||	Background	|||	Operation Theseus	|||

These Austrian reinforcements entered Saxony on 10 June and by the third day, an Austrian force of over 6,000 men under Major Am Ende captured the capital, [[Dresden]]. Von Thielmann and his Saxons were forced back to Gorbitz, whilst the Saxon Royal Family hurriedly fled west. Meanwhile, another force of 6,000 men under [[Paul von Radivojevich]] wheeled south into [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], another French ally, capturing [[Bayreuth]] on 14 June. From here, Radivojevich could threaten an invasion of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] or an attempt to reinforce the [[Battles of Bergisel|Tyrolean uprising]].	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

The Allied Armies [[Dyle Plan|attempted to halt the German Army in Belgium]], believing it to be the main German thrust. After the Allies had fully committed the best of the Allied Armies to Belgium on the 10th through the 12th of May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a [[Manstein Plan|break through]], or sickle cut, through the [[Ardennes]], and advanced to the [[English Channel]].	|||		|||		|||

Only the [[Maryland Campaign]], with its tactically inconclusive [[Battle of Antietam]], had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G.

[[Ginchy]] is {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} north-east of Guillemont, at the junction of six roads on a rise overlooking Combles, {{convert|4|km|mi}} to the south-east. After the conclusion of the [[Battle of Guillemont]] on 6 September, [[XIV Corps (United Kingdom)|XIV Corps]] and [[XV Corps (United Kingdom)|XV Corps]] were required to complete the advance to positions which would give observation over the German third position, ready for a general attack in mid-September, for which the Anglo-French armies had been preparing since early August. British attacks from the boundary between the  [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] and the [[Sixth Army (France)|French Sixth Army]] from Leuze Wood north to Ginchy, had begun on 3 September when the 7th Division captured the village, before being forced out by a German counter-attack. Attacks on Leuze Wood and attempts to re-take Ginchy on 4 and 5 September were also defeated by German counter-attacks. The 7th Division was relieved by the 16th Division and 55th Division on the evening of 7 September and the 5th Division was replaced by the 56th Division on the right at the army boundary.	|||		|||		|||

A pause in Anglo-French attacks at the end of August, to organise bigger combined attacks and postponements for bad weather, coincided with the largest counter-attack by the German army in the Battle of the Somme. Joffre, Foch and Haig abandoned attempts to organise large combined attacks, in favour of sequenced army attacks and the capture of the German defences from Cléry north of the Somme, to Guillemont from {{nowrap|3–6 September,}} brought the French Sixth and British Fourth armies onto ground which overlooked the German third position. Rain, congestion and reliefs of tired divisions then forced a pause in French attacks until 12 September. In the [[Battle of Ginchy]] (9 September) the Fourth Army captured the village, ready for the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]], (15–22 September).	|||		|||		|||

Gough already had a reputation, whether deserved or not, for unimaginative head-on tactics. On 22 November at [[Battle of Ramnagar|Ramnagar]], his cavalry were repulsed attacking a Sikh bridgehead on the east bank of the Chenab. Then on 13 January 1849, he launched a hasty frontal attack against Sher Singh's army at [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] near the [[Jhelum River]] and was driven back with heavy casualties.

Initial French preparations to raid the hill were continued by the British [[28th Division (United Kingdom)|28th Division]], which took over the line in February 1915 and then by the [[5th Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]]. The plan was expanded into an ambitious attempt to capture the hill, despite advice that Hill 60 could not be held unless the 'Caterpillar' nearby was also occupied.

The Japanese attack was not preceded by a declaration of war and so was in clear violation of international law.  [[British Army|British]], [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] and [[British Indian Army|Indian]] forces, commanded by Major-General [[Christopher Maltby]] supported by the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps resisted the Japanese attack by the Japanese 21st, 23rd and the 38th Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Takashi Sakai]], but were outnumbered nearly four to one (Japanese, 52,000; Allied, 14,000) and lacked their opponents' recent combat experience.	|||	Battle	|||		|||

The end result of the battle was the opposite of what had occurred on those same fields almost 100 years earlier, when the armies of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] had faced the armies of France during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. At the Second Battle of Höchstädt in 1704, called the [[Battle of Blenheim]] by the English, the overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the Grand Alliance. France's loss during that engagement opened the pathway into France for the allied English and Austrian forces.	|||		|||		|||

0	Battle of Ia Drang	|||	First Indochina War	|||	The VC forces were in nominal control of most of the countryside by 1965 and had established military infrastructure in the [[Tây Nguyên|Central Highlands]], to the north-east of the [[Saigon]] region. Vietnamese communist forces had operated in this area during the previous decade in the [[First Indochina War]] against the French, winning a notable victory at the [[Battle of Mang Yang Pass]] in 1954. There were few reliable roads into the area, making it an ideal place for the communist forces to form bases, relatively immune from attack by the generally road-bound ARVN forces. During 1965, large groups of North Vietnamese regulars of the PAVN moved into the area, to conduct offensive operations. Attacks to the south-west from these bases threatened to cut South Vietnam in two. The U.S. command saw this as an ideal area to test new [[air mobility]] tactics.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Imphal	|||	Battle of Singapore	|||	Based on his experiences in the campaigns in [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] and in the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]] in early 1942, Mutaguchi dismissed British and Indian troops as inherently inferior. The troops he had met on those occasions had generally been inadequately trained and led. The Allies had by now largely overcome the administrative and organisational problems which had crippled their early efforts in Burma, and their troops were far better trained and motivated.	|||	The situation	|||	Japanese plan	|||
0	Battle of Inverlochy (1645)	|||	Battle of Aberdeen (1644)	|||	Argyll did not stay for the battle, but instead he left the command of his army to his general, Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck, and retired to his galley anchored on [[Loch Linnhe]]. Auchinbreck lined up the covenanters in front of Inverlochy castle, which he reinforced with 200 musketeers to protect his left flank. In the centre he placed the Campbells of Argyll and put the lowland militias on the flanks. Unlike at [[Battle of Tippermuir|Tippermuir]] and [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Aberdeen]], where Montrose had annihilated hastily [[conscript]]ed and poorly trained [[militia]]s, the troops he faced at Inverlochy were veterans of the [[English Civil War|war in England]]. Montrose lined his army up in only two lines deep to avoid being out flanked, placing his 600 highlanders in the centre with the Irish on the flanks, the right being commanded by [[Alasdair MacColla|MacColla]]. The fight did not start straight away and instead skirmishes broke out along the line. This is probably because Auchinbreck and his officers believed that they were only fighting one of Montrose's lieutenants and not the man himself, believing he was still far up the glen. Just before first light, the Royalists launched their attack.	|||		|||		|||

This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the [[Battle of Saipan]]. In those attacks, for which the Marines were prepared, the majority of the Japanese attackers had been killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these 'human wave' attacks by the Japanese infantrymen because he considered them to be futile.	|||	Amphibious landing	|||		|||
0	Battle of Iwo Jima	|||	Operation Downfall	|||	At the end of the [[Battle of Leyte]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were left with a two-month lull in their offensive operations before the planned [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an [[air base]] for Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighter plane]]s to intercept long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers, and it provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands|air attacks on the Mariana Islands]] from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for [[Operation Downfall]] - the eventual invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The distance of B-29 raids could (hypothetically) be cut in half, and a base would be available for [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters to escort and protect the bombers.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Battle of Jackson, Mississippi	|||	Jackson Expedition	|||	General Sherman appointed Brig. Gen. [[Joseph A. Mower]] to the position of military governor of Jackson and ordered him to destroy all facilities that could benefit the war effort. With the discovery of a large supply of rum, it was impossible for Mower's Brigade to keep order among the mass of soldiers and camp followers, and many acts of pillage took place. Grant left Jackson on the afternoon of May 15 and proceeded to [[Clinton, Mississippi]]. On the morning of May 16 he sent orders for Sherman to move out of Jackson as soon as the destruction was complete. Sherman marched almost immediately, clearing the city by 10 a.m.. By nightfall on May 16, Sherman's corps reached [[Bolton, Mississippi]], and the Confederacy had reoccupied what remained of Jackson. Jackson had been destroyed as a transportation center and the war industries were crushed. But more importantly the Confederate concentration of men and materials aimed at saving Vicksburg were scattered.  Sherman would later lead an [[Jackson Expedition|expedition against Jackson]] following the fall of Vicksburg to clear Johnston's relief force from the area.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

In the [[Capitulation of Erfurt]] on 16 October, a large body of Prussian troops became prisoners with hardly a shot being fired. Bernadotte crushed [[Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of Württemberg]]'s Prussian Reserve on the 17th in the [[Battle of Halle]]. Davout led his exhausted III Corps into Berlin on 25 October. Hohenlohe's force surrendered on 28 October after the [[Battle of Prenzlau]], followed soon after by the [[Capitulation of Pasewalk]]. The French ran down and captured several small Prussian columns at [[Boldekow]] on 30 October, [[Anklam]] on 1 November, [[Wolgast]] on 3 November, and [[Wismar]] on 5 November. The corps of Blücher and Winning were destroyed at the [[Battle of Lübeck]] on 6 and 7 November.

However, in Pandi, Bulacan and San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, the revolution had heated up. The Katipuneros in Bulacan established the Kakarong Republic and build a fort in the Real de Kakarong area. Sources say that it was like a miniature city, according to the biography of [[Gregorio del Pilar]] (then at the time a officer of the military forces of the Kakarong area), entitled 'Life and Death of a Boy General' written by [[Teodoro Kalaw]], a fort was constructed at 'Kakarong de Sili' that was like a miniature city. It had streets, an independent police force, a military band, a military arsenal with factories for bolos and field artillery, and repair shops for rifles and cartridges. The Kakarong Republic had a complete set of officials, with Canuto Villanueva as Supreme Chief and Captain General of the military forces, and [[Eusebio Roque]], also known by his nom-de-guerre 'Maestrong Sebio', then head of the Katipunan local organization (''Balangay Dimas-Alang'' serving the town of [[Pandi, Bulacan]]), as Brigadier General of the Army of the Republic.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

Bradley was appointed assistant Corps Commander and moved up to command of II Corps when Patton returned to planning for Sicily. Fredendall was reassigned to the United States and several other commanders were removed or promoted out of the way. Patton was not known for hesitancy and did not bother to request permission when taking action to support his command or other units requesting assistance. During the advance from [[Gafsa]], General Alexander had given detailed orders to Patton, afterwards changing II Corps' mission several times. Once beyond Maknassy, Alexander again gave orders Patton considered excessively detailed. From then on, Patton simply ignored those parts of mission orders he considered ill-advised on grounds of military expediency and/or a rapidly evolving tactical situation.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

The  [[2nd Light Horse Brigade]], and the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]], were sent to Katia and Romani and established a strong Imperial presence over the contested ground. Soon after, the Australian [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] was also sent forward, and the [[52nd (Lowland) Division]] arrived at Romani not long after. At the beginning of August, the [[Battle of Romani]] was fought over much of the same ground as that at Katia.	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Kehl (1796)	|||	Siege of Kehl (1733)	|||	Although separated politically and geographically, the fates of Kehl, a village on the eastern shore of the Rhine in [[Baden-Durlach]], and those of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] city of [[Strasbourg]], on the western shore, were united by the presence of bridges and a series of gates, fortifications and [[Barrage (dam)|barrage dam]]s that allowed passage across the river. In the 1790s, the Rhine was wild, unpredictable, and difficult to cross, in some places more than four or more times wider than it is in the twenty-first century, even under non-flood conditions. Its channels and tributaries wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons. The fortifications at Kehl and Strasbourg had been constructed by the fortress architect [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Sébastien le Préstre de Vauban]] in the seventeenth century. The crossings had been contested before: in 1678 during the French-Dutch war, in [[Siege of Kehl (1703)|1703]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in [[Siege of Kehl (1733)|1733]] during the [[War of the Polish Succession]]. Critical to success of the French plan would be the army's ability  to cross the Rhine at will. Consequently, control of the crossings at [[Hüningen]], near the Swiss city of [[Basle|Basel]], and at Kehl, would give them ready access to most of southwestern Germany; from there, French armies could sweep north, south, or east, depending on their military goal.	|||		|||		|||

To these Greeks suffered 8,828 casualties. On the Bulgarian right [[Evzones]] captured [[Gevgelija]] and the heights of Matsikovo. As a consequence the Bulgarian line of retreat through Doiran was threatened and Ivanov's army began a desperate retreat which at times threatened to become a rout. Reinforcements came too late and joined the retreat towards Strumica and the Bulgarian border. The Greeks captured [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Dojran]] on 5 July but were unable to cut off the Bulgarian retreat through [[Struma Pass]]. On 11 July the Greeks came in contact with the Serbs and then pushed on up the [[Struma River]] until they reached [[Kresna Gorge]] on 24 July.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

0	Battle of Leipzig	|||	War of the Third Coalition	|||	With the three monarchs of the continental Coalition powers, Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]] being at the head of the three along with King [[Frederick William III]] of Prussia and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of Austria, present in the field, a substantial staff supported the Coalition commanders. Tsar Alexander I was also the supreme commander of all Coalition forces in the eastern front of the war, while Prince Schwarzenberg of Austria was the commander-in-chief of all Coalition forces in the German theatre.  For the Tsar, this was the second time that he had filled in as a battlefield commander since [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] almost a decade prior during the [[War of the Third Coalition]]. Initially, the command was plagued with incompetence and petty rivalries in conflict with each other and its operations were prone to the vanities of the monarchs, especially from the Russian emperor, but these largely evaporated as the battle raged on, with the command largely centering on the two main commanders during the battle.	|||	Preparations	|||	Coalition's plans	|||

However, it faced the problem of countering the Greek flagship, the {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}, which had already defeated them at [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]]. The Ottomans developed the plan to slip a fast cruiser through the Greek patrols for a raiding mission in the Aegean, hoping to draw off some Greek ships, possibly even the ''Georgios Averof'' itself, in pursuit, leaving the remainder weakened for the Ottoman fleet to attack. Indeed, the cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}} evaded the Greek lookout ships on the night of 13/14 January 1913, and sunk a Greek transport ship at [[Syros]] the next day, also bombarding the island's harbour. This action caused concern in Athens, and an order was sent to the Fleet, commanding it to 'sail immediately in pursuit'. Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] refused to obey, suspecting an Ottoman trap, and instead prepared for the inevitable exit of the Ottoman Fleet from the [[Dardanelles]] Straits.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||

La Réunion lost her shipping communications with mainland Africa, and the attack further encouraged anti-British sentiments among the Vichy loyalists. On the other hand, De Gaulle, who had not been involved in ''Ironclad'', felt hard-pressed to re-claim La Réunion from Vichy before the British or Americans would.	|||	 Background 	|||	 Strategic situation 	|||

However, the Soviets were thrown back the following day, and their counterattacks at 13:30 and 19:00 that day did not amount to anything. By July 7, the focus of the Soviet attacks was already moving to the area of Vuoksi, and the Soviets now began transferring their best troops to the [[Battle of Narva (1944)|Narva front]] in Estonia, to fight the Germans and the [[20 SS|Estonians]]. From July 9, the Soviet troops no longer attempted a break-through. Nevertheless, some fighting continued.  Soviet forces were ordered to cease offensive operations and take up defensive positions on July 10 as the Stavka redeployed forces to the Baltic fronts, where the Red Army was encountering 'fierce German and Baltic resistance.'	|||	Ihantala: July 1 – July 9	|||		|||

It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] ('The Hot Gates'). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].	|||		|||		|||
0	Battle of Thermopylae	|||	Battle of Salamis	|||	After this engagement, the Greek navy—under the command of the Athenian politician Themistocles—at Artemisium received news of the defeat at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada—attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Fearful of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.	|||		|||		|||

On 22 May, the 'Tiger'—mounted on a white horse—led a Japanese force towards [[Remexio]]. An Australian patrol, with Portuguese and Timorese assistance, staged an ambush and killed four or five of the Japanese soldiers.

0	Battle of Tolentino	|||	Battle of Scapezzano	|||	On the second day, fog delayed the start of battle until 7 o'clock. The day started well for Murat as the Neapolitan army managed to finally take Rancia Castle as well as the hills of Cantagallo. From here, the Neapolitans staged a further attack on the Austrian positions. Two Neapolitan infantry divisions, including Murat's Guard division, descended from Monte Milone against the Austrian left flank. However, the Neapolitans made the mistake of forming squares expecting a swift cavalry counterattack, which never happened. The Austrian infantry delivered a series of volleys, supported by devastating artillery fire. Meanwhile, General Mohr had also repulsed an attack on the Austrian right and the entire Neapolitan line fell back to Pollenza. With the result of the battle still undecided, Murat received word Neipperg had defeated Carascosa at the [[Battle of Scapezzano]] and was approaching. To make matters worse, he received false rumours that a British fleet had just unloaded a Sicilian army in the south of Italy, threatening his line of retreat. Unbeknownst to Murat, the British fleet were in fact sailing to blockade Naples and Ancona. Sensing the inevitable, Murat sounded the retreat, and the fighting ended. Murat fell back to Naples, but with the Austrians approaching by land and the British by sea, he had no choice but to flee to [[Corsica]] disguised as a Danish sailor. The battle proved decisive; on 20 May 1815, Austria and Naples concluded the [[Treaty of Casalanza]], restoring [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] to the throne.	|||	 Battle 	|||		|||

On 21 June, Wellington's army inflicted a decisive defeat on Joseph's troops at the [[Battle of Vitoria]]. As the defeated French armies withdrew toward the [[Pyrenees]], Wellington tried to intercept Foy's column in the north and [[Bertrand Clausel]]'s forces in the south. Neither Foy nor Clausel had fought at Vitoria. Graham caught up with Foy's column, but after some fighting, the French got away. Clausel also managed to avoid being cut off, but except for the [[Siege of San Sebastian|Sieges of San Sebastian]] and [[Siege of Pamplona (1813)|Pamplona]], northern Spain was soon free of French occupation. The next pitched battle was the [[Battle of the Pyrenees]] which began on 25 July.	|||		|||		|||

Imperial forces across southern France were greatly demoralised by fighting the Anglo-Allied forces in their own country, and were further shaken by news of repeated Coalition victories in northern and eastern France. Allied campaigning had gradually pushed French forces out of [[Spain]] during 1813, after endless [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla wars]] which had resulted in more than 300,000 French casualties between 1808 and late 1813.

0	Battle of Villalar	|||	Peninsular War	|||	The Battle of Villalar would later be claimed by Spanish liberals as the blow that extinguished Castilian liberties in favor of autocratic Spanish monarchy.

Later, some city councils called for celebrations at Villalar in the 1920s. After the end of Franco's dictatorship, this view became more generalized. The [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and León]] made April 23 the official holiday of [[Castile and León Day]] in 1986, although it had been popularly celebrated since 1976.

Burnside left [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in mid-August 1863. The direct route ran through the Confederate-held Cumberland Gap. Burnside had been delayed in earlier attempts to move out against Knoxville and thus chose not to spend the time to force a passage of the gap. Instead he detached one brigade under Colonel John F. DeCourcy to pose a threat to Brigadier General [[John W. Frazer]]'s 2,300 man garrison, while the rest of the army bypassed to the south over 40 miles in rugged mountainous terrain.   DeCourcy had previously led a brigade in the [[Battle of the Cumberland Gap (June 1862)|1862 operations against the Cumberland Gap]] under [[George W. Morgan]].	|||	Background	|||		|||

Even though he held a strong defensive position, Morgan was far from any Union base with no established supply lines.  His reports to Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]] however remained full of optimism. As late as August, 1862 Morgan reported he had no intentions of evacuating the gap and 'if the enemy attacks he will be crushed'.  Kirby Smith's attention had been devoted to securing Chattanooga.  It was not until Confederates under [[Braxton Bragg]] [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|invaded Kentucky]] that Morgan found himself facing a serious Confederate threat.  Morgan was forced to abandon the gap in September 1862, but managed to conduct a masterful withdrawal through enemy territory.  The Cumberland Gap would remain in Confederate control until Maj. Gen.

0	Battle of the Piave River	|||	Operation Michael	|||	The Austrians, differently from their previous success at Caporetto and from the subsequent attempts to breakthrough on [[Monte Grappa]], did not prepare the attack as a pinpoint one, but as an all-out frontal attack, employing the entire residual strength of their army all along the front. The Austro-Hungarian formations were trained to employ the tactics developed by the Germans on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the [[Spring Offensive|Operation Michael]] as Austrian officials, returning from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], were extensively trained alongside their German counterparts. There were also innovations on the Italian side. Analyzing the defeat of Caporetto, the staff of Armando Diaz concluded that the main tactical causes of it were the lack of mobility of Italian units, caught in a too rigid defensive scheme, the too centralized command and control system, and the lack of depth of Italian defences, where too many soldiers were simply stuck on the frontline. The new schemes prepared for the battle led to the abolition of the [[Trench warfare|continuous entrenchment]] and in the development of a highly mobile defence system, in which even the smaller units were allowed to freely move between previously recognized strongpoints, independently decide to retreat or counterattack, or directly call the support of the artillery. Moreover, 13 divisions, equipped with 6000 trucks, were organized in a central reserve, ready to be sent where it was needed.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||

0	Battle of Öland	|||	Second Anglo-Dutch War	|||	While the Swedish policy was to avoid war and to consolidate its gains, Danish policy after 1660 was to seek an opportunity to regain its losses. Under the [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]], the foreign policy was aimed at isolating Sweden while setting itself up in a favorable position in future wars. Denmark attempted to position itself in the alliances among the 17th century Europe great powers. [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[early modern France|France]] and the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]-dominated [[Holy Roman Empire]] competed for continental domination while the Dutch Republic and England [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|fought several wars]] over naval hegemony. At the same time, Denmark sought to rid itself of the generous toll treaties it was forced to grant Dutch merchants after the Republic's assistance in the wars against Sweden. Attempts were made to ally with both England and France, but without success. In the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665–66) Denmark had to side with the Dutch at the [[Battle of Vågen]], souring its relations with England. In 1670 France allied with England against the Republic. Sweden's relations with France had improved greatly and in 1672 it joined the Anglo-French coalition, pushing Denmark into the Dutch camp.	|||	Background	|||		|||

During this operation, the destroyer leader ''Moskva'' was lost to mines while evading fire from coastal batteries. The Black Sea Fleet supplied the besieged garrison in [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|Odessa]] and evacuated a significant part of the force (86,000 soldiers, 150,000 civilians) at the end of October, but lost the destroyer ''Frunze'' and a gunboat to ''[[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka]]s'' in the process. The Black Sea Fleet played a valuable part in defeating the initial assault on Sevastopol. In December, there was an amphibious operation against [[Kerch]] which resulted in the recapture of the Kerch Peninsula. A naval detachment including the cruiser [[Soviet cruiser Krasnyi Krym|Krasnyi Krym]] remained in Sevastopol to give gunfire support.

In Saigon, Viet Cong guerrillas attempted to assassinate President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]] at the [[Independence Palace]] but were quickly beaten back. Some writers have suggested that due to the similarities of both attacks by an almost identical number of commandos (31 in Seoul and 34 in Saigon, respectively) that the North Korean leaders had a certain insight into Vietnamese Communist military operations, and wanted to take advantage of the Vietnam War.  [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] regarded the seizure of the ''Pueblo'' and the timing of the Tet Offensive to have been coordinated to divert U.S. resources away from Vietnam and to force the South Koreans to withdraw their two Divisions and Marine Brigade from South Vietnam. Unlike President Johnson, [[Charles H. Bonesteel III|General Bonesteel]] saw no such connection. He regarded the Blue House Raid as having been planned at the highest levels in North Korea, while the seizure of the ''Pueblo'' seemed merely opportunistic and the timing of the Tet Offensive as helpful but coincidental.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

0	British occupation of the Jordan Valley	|||	Battle of Romani	|||	The troops' general careworn appearance was very noticeable; they were not actually ill but lacked proper sleep and the effects of this deprivation were intensified by the heat, dust, humidity, pressure effect, stillness of the air, and mosquitoes which together with the cumulative effects of the hardships of the two previous years of campaigning caused a general depression. These extremely depressing effects of the region in turn contributed to the debility of troops after a period in the valley. Their shelter was most often just bivouac sheets which barely allowed the men room to sit up; there were a few [[bell tent]]s in which temperatures reached {{convert|125|°F|°C}}. However, although they worked long hours in the hot sun patrolling, digging, wiring, caring for the horses and carrying out anti-mosquito work, heat exhaustion was never a problem (as it had in the Sinai desert; in particular on the second day of the [[Battle of Romani]]) as there was easy access to large supplies of pure, cool water for drinking and washing. Springs supplied drinking water and supplies of rations and forage were transported to the valley from Jerusalem. But thirst was constant and very large quantities of fluid; more than {{convert|1|impgal|l}} were consumed, while meat rations (in the absence of refrigeration) consisted mainly of tins of '[[bully beef]]', which was often stewed by the hot conditions while still in the cans, and bread was always dry and there were few fresh vegetables.	|||	 Background 	|||	 Conditions in the valley 	|||

The British front in Picardy held by 300,000 soldiers collapsed when powerful assaults were launched on both sides of the Somme by a force of 750,000, forcing Gough's Fifth Army back almost to Amiens. On one day; 23 March German forces advanced {{convert|12|mi|km}} and captured 600 guns; in total 1,000 guns and 160,000 suffered the worst defeat of the war. The British War Cabinet recognised at once that the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire must be at least postponed.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

The [[IJA 31st Division|31st Division]] would meanwhile isolate Imphal by capturing [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]]. Mutaguchi intended to exploit this victory by capturing the strategic city of [[Dimapur]], in the [[Brahmaputra River]] valley. If this could be achieved, his army would be through the mountainous border region and the whole of North East India would be open to attack. Units of the Indian National Army were to take part in the offensive and raise rebellion in India. The capture of the Dimapur railhead would also sever the land communications to the airbases used to supply the Chinese via the 'Hump', and cut off supplies to General Stilwell's forces fighting on the Northern Front.	|||	Central front	|||		|||

Fifty-eight percent blamed the students for what had occurred at Kent State. On both sides, emotions ran high.  In one instance, in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration construction workers [[Hard Hat Riot|rioted]] and attacked demonstrating students.  Such violence, however, was an aberration. Most demonstrations, both pro- and anti-war, were peaceful.

0	Cambodian–Vietnamese War	|||	Vietnam War	|||	During the [[Vietnam War]], Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists had formed an alliance to fight U.S.-backed regimes in their respective countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to preempt an attempt by the Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the [[Lon Nol]] regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began waging a war against Vietnam, which was marked by an attack on the Vietnamese island of [[Phú Quốc]]. In spite of the fighting that had occurred between the two countries, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean Government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved.	|||		|||		|||

Following their victory at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1813), Russian, Austrian and other German armies of the Sixth Coalition entered France. Despite the disproportionate forces in favour of the Coalition, Napoleon managed to inflict many defeats, especially during the [[Six Days Campaign]]. However, the Coalition kept heading towards Paris, which capitulated in March 1814. As a result, Napoleon was deposed and exiled to [[Elba]] and the victorious powers started to redraw the map of Europe during the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|First Treaty of Paris]] and during the early stages of the [[Congress of Vienna]].	|||		|||		|||

Its purpose was to crush [[Charles XII|Charles XII's]] army with overwhelming force in a combined offensive of Russian and Saxon troops. The campaign, executed by [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]] and [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II of Saxony]], began in July 1705 and lasted almost a year. In divided areas the allies would jointly strike the Swedish troops occupied in Poland, in order to neutralize the influence the Swedes had in the Polish politics. However, the Swedish forces under Charles XII successfully outmaneuvered the allies, installed a Polish king in favor of their own and finally won two decisive victories at [[Battle of Grodno (1706)|Grodno]] and [[Battle of Fraustadt|Fraustadt]] in 1706. This resulted in the [[Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)]] in which Augustus renounced his claims to the Polish throne, broke off his alliance with Russia, and established peace between Sweden and Saxony.	|||		|||		|||

0	Canada's Hundred Days	|||	Hindenburg Line	|||	'''Canada's Hundred Days''' was a series of attacks made along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] by the [[Canadian Corps]] during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of World War I. Reference to this period as Canada's Hundred Days is due to the substantial role the [[Canadian Corps]] of the [[British First Army]] played in causing the defeat and/or retreat of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] in a series of major battles from [[Amiens]] to [[Mons]] which along with other Allied offensives ultimately led to Germany's final defeat and surrender. During this time, the [[Canadian Corps]] fought at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Arras]], the [[Hindenburg Line]], the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord|Canal du Nord]], [[Bourlon Wood Memorial|Bourlon Wood]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]], [[Denain]], [[Valenciennes]] and finally at [[Mons]], on the final day of the First World War.

0	Capture of Combles	|||	Operation Michael	|||	Combles was attacked by the British and French on 25 September, during the [[Battle of Morval]] after several delays due to rain and poor visibility. Brigades from the 56th and 5th divisions in the north, wheeled to the right to form a south-facing flank above Combles, as the French [[2nd Infantry Division (France)|2nd Division]] attacked from the south. The British attack swiftly established the defensive flank and patrols began to probe southwards. German resistance against the French attack close to the village, particularly with machine-gun fire, held back the advance but further east, the French captured Rancourt in the afternoon and closed up to Frégicourt. Prisoners taken by the British and French, revealed that a retirement from the village was intended during the night and a constant Allied artillery barrage was maintained on the exits. Infantry patrols probed forwards and the British and French forces met at several points in and east of the village, in the early hours of 26 September. A huge amount of equipment, ammunition and engineering stores were captured in the village and on 27 September, the inter-army boundary was moved north to Morval, to assist French attacks towards Sailly-Saillisel. On 24 March 1918, Combles was recaptured by German troops, during the retreat of the 9th Division in [[Operation Michael]], the German spring offensive.

This left Aznar in a complicated situation: if Basque terrorists were proven to be responsible for the massacre, it would favour the PP's campaign, but if an Islamic group appeared to cause the blast, people might blame him for earning himself (and Spain) enemies.	|||	Accuracy of government statements	|||		|||

0	First Battle of Bull Run	|||	Battle of Fort Sumter	|||	Just months after the start of the war at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], the  Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion. Yielding to political pressure, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] led his unseasoned Union Army across [[Bull Run (Occoquan River)|Bull Run]] against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.	|||		|||		|||
0	First Battle of Chattanooga	|||	Battle of the Cumberland Gap (June 1862)	|||	After Mitchel received command of all Federal troops between Nashville and Huntsville on May 29, he ordered [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James Negley]] with a small division to lead an expedition to capture [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. This force arrived before Chattanooga on June 7. Negley ordered the [[79th Pennsylvania Infantry]] out to reconnoiter. It found the Confederates entrenched on the opposite side of the river along the banks and atop Cameron Hill. Negley brought up two artillery batteries to open fire on the Rebel troops and the town and sent infantry to the river bank to act as sharpshooters. The Union bombardment of Chattanooga continued throughout June 7 and until noon on June 8. The Confederates replied, but it was uncoordinated since the undisciplined gunners were allowed to do as they wished. On June 10, Smith, who had arrived on June 8, reported that Negley had withdrawn and the Confederate loss was minor. This attack on Chattanooga was a warning that Union troops could mount assaults when they wanted.  The attack also prompted [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] to withdraw Confederate troops from other areas to defend Chattanooga.  This redeployment of troops allowed [[George W. Morgan]] to [[Battle of the Cumberland Gap (June 1862)|capture the Cumberland Gap]] on June 18, 1862.	|||	Battle	|||		|||

0	First Battle of Murfreesboro	|||	Battle of Stones River	|||	The Confederates destroyed much of the Union supplies and tore up railroad track in the area, but the main result of the raid was the diversion of Union forces from a drive on Chattanooga. This raid, along with Morgan's raid into Kentucky, made possible Bragg's concentration of forces at Chattanooga and his early September invasion of Kentucky. The next action at Murfreesboro was the more prominent [[Battle of Stones River]] (known as the Battle of Murfreesboro in the South), fought December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	First Battle of Zurich	|||	Battle of Stockach (1799)	|||	The Austrians had arrayed their own army in a line from the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] to the Danube. A force of 46,000 under command of [[Count Heinrich von Bellegarde]] formed the defence of the Tyrol. Another small Austrian force of 26,000 commanded by [[Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze]] guarded the [[Vorarlberg]]. The main Austrian Army—close to 80,000 troops under the command of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]]—had wintered in the Bavarian, Austrian, and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]] territories on the eastern side of the [[Lech (river)|Lech river]]. At the battles of [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] (21 March) and [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]] (25 March), the main Austrian force pushed the Army of the Danube back into the Black Forest. Charles made plans to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of [[Schaffhausen]]. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a portion (approximately 8,000) of his force west, leaving the rest to defend the Vorarlberg. At the same time, [[Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf]], brought the left wing of the main Austrian force across the Rhine by Eglisau. They planned to unite with the main Austrian army, controlling the northern access points of [[Zürich]] and forcing an engagement with Masséna.	|||	Background	|||	Outbreak of war in 1799	|||

While the Spanish Empire collapsed, the maritime trade trickled to the Americas and Philippines, and Spain's military struggled to keep their colonies, with [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico getting its independence in 1821]]. The customary overseas revenue to the metropolis was at a historic low, the royal coffers were empty.

German gas attacks on allied troops had begun on 22 April 1915, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] using [[chlorine|chlorine gas]], against French and Canadian units. The surprise led to the capture of much of the [[Ypres Salient]], after which the effectiveness of gas as a weapon diminished, as the French and British produced anti-gas helmets. The German [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]]-[[Carl Duisberg|Duisberg]]-Commission investigated the feasibility of adding the much more lethal [[phosgene]] to chlorine gas. Mixed chlorine and phosgene gas was used at the end of May 1915, in attacks against French troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against the Russian army.	|||		|||		|||

The Armée du Nord, now under command of [[Jean Nicolas Houchard]] defeated York's exposed left flank under the Hanoverian general [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Freytag|Freytag]] at the [[Battle of Hondschoote (1793)|Battle of Hondschoote]], forcing York to raise the siege and abandon his equipment. The Anglo-Hanoverians fell back in good order to [[Veurne]] (Furnes), where they were able to recover as there was no French pursuit. Houchard's plan had actually been to merely repulse the Duke of York so he could march south to relieve Le Quesnoy; on 13 September he defeated the Hereditary Prince at [[Battle of Menin (1793)|Menin]] ([[Menen]]), capturing 40 guns and driving the Dutch towards Bruges and Ghent, but three days later his forces were routed in turn by [[Johann Peter Beaulieu|Beaulieu]] at [[Battle of Courtrai (1793)|Courtrai]].	|||	1793 campaign	|||	Autumn Campaign	|||

The German gas was of sufficient concentration to penetrate the British [[PH helmet|PH gas helmets]] and the 16th Division was unjustly blamed for poor gas discipline.

Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps.  The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20 years earlier.	|||	Aftermath	|||	France	|||

At first, wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners to take control of the island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth and power.  There were so many twists and turns in the leadership in France, and there were so many complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.	|||	Impact of the French Revolution	|||		|||

Grey reactivated the invasion plans in June 1863 amid mounting tension between Kingites and the colonial government and fears of a raid on [[Auckland]] by extremist Kingite Māori. Grey used as the trigger for the invasion Kingite rejection of his ultimatum on 9 July 1863 that all Māori living between [[Auckland]] and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]] or be expelled south of the [[Waikato River]].

During the 1972 Olympic Games, a firefight between a group of hostage-takers and West German police left a police officer and all the hostages dead. The British government, worried that the country was unprepared for a similar crisis in the United Kingdom, ordered the formation of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing of the SAS, which became the UK's primary anti-terrorist and anti-hijacking unit. The SAS had taken part in counter-insurgency operations abroad since 1945, and had trained the bodyguards of influential people whose deaths would be contrary to British interests. Thus, it was believed to be better prepared for the role than any unit in the police or elsewhere in the armed forces. The CRW Wing's first operational experience was the storming of [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] in 1977, when a small detachment of soldiers were sent to assist [[GSG 9]]—the elite West German police unit set up after the events of 1972.	|||	Background	|||	Special Air Service	|||

0	Kosovo War	|||	First Balkan War	|||	Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13), [[World War I]] (1914–18), and [[World War II]] (1939–45). After 1945 the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|socialist]] government under [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed all manifestations of [[nationalism]] throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, Tito diluted the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]—the largest and most populous republic—by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north and in [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946–1974)|Kosovo]] in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians remained in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Albanians in Serbia|Serbia]]). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. The [[UDBA|secret police]] (the UDBA) cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956 a number of [[Albanians]] went on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] had little political significance. Their long-term impact became substantial, though, as some—particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded{{when|date=October 2014}} by [[Adem Demaçi]]—would eventually form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (founded in 1990). Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.	|||	Background	|||	Kosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945–1980)	|||

The IJN briefly sent two aircraft carriers to chase TFs 16 and 17, but quickly abandoned the pursuit and continued their support for the ongoing, successful conquests of the [[Philippines]] and [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The raids, however, did help lift the morale of the U.S. Navy and American public, still reeling from the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]] and loss of [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island]]. The raids also provided valuable experience in carrier air operations, which hardened the U.S. carrier groups for future combat against Japanese forces.  For their part, the Japanese apparently did not realize that their concept of a [[perimeter defense]] using dispersed island garrisons had serious flaws in that the garrisons were too far apart to be sufficiently mutually supporting to prevent penetration by enemy carrier forces. The raids, along with the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942, helped convince the IJN's [[Combined Fleet]] commander, [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], that he needed to draw the American carriers into battle as soon as possible in order to destroy them.

0	New Georgia Campaign	|||	Battle off Horaniu	|||	The Japanese high command in Tokyo had already decided that no more troops would be wasted in the central Solomons. Rather than reinforce and defend Vella Lavella, it was to be used merely as a way station for the evacuation of the troops on Kolombangara that had been bypassed by the Allies with this new landing. Horaniu on the northeast coast was selected as a barge staging point and on the night of 17–18 August two Army companies and a Navy platoon were landed there. The covering force of four destroyers was met in The Slot by an American force, also made up of four destroyers under Captain Thomas J. Ryan, that had been sent to disrupt the operation. In the ensuing [[Battle off Horaniu]], no ships of either side were lost and the Japanese succeeded in establishing a barge base.	|||	Outlying Islands	|||	 Vella Lavella	|||

Sullivan and his troops systematically destroyed Iroquois villages, successfully driving the Iroquois north into Quebec.

Brant led raids that specifically targeted the villages of the Oneida and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], who also supported the American cause.  This destruction of Indian villages on both sides effectively depopulated much of the Iroquois territory as the survivors of the raids became refugees, but Sullivan's expedition failed in its objective of stopping or reducing the frequency of frontier attacks.

This fear was raised by military intelligence chief [[Eli Zeira]] at a situation assessment with the Chief of Staff on October 9. This avoidance is more noticeable due to the significant strikes which were conducted by Israel during the [[War of Attrition]]. These strikes caused significant damage to the Egyptian military and forced it to retreat to defend the Egyptian front, therefore weakening its offensive capabilities.

Examination of the area after its capture, indicated some destruction of German equipment, including the wreckage of ten of the forty trucks believed to be in the area at the time of the raid.

American Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]]'s intention was to take advantage of the German preoccupation with British and Canadian activity around the town of [[Caen]], in [[Operation Goodwood]],  and immediately punch through the German defenses that were penning in his troops while the Germans were distracted and unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would then be able to advance into [[Brittany]], rolling up the German flanks and releasing itself of the constraints imposed by operating in the Norman [[bocage]] countryside. After a slow start the offensive gathered momentum, and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the [[Seine]]. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual, and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second British]] and [[First Canadian Army|First Canadian]] Armies, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy Campaign.	|||		|||		|||
0	Operation Colossus	|||	Battle of France	|||	'''Operation Colossus''' was the codename given to the first [[airborne forces|airborne]] operation undertaken by the British military, which occurred on 10 February 1941 during [[World War II]]. The British airborne establishment was formed in June 1940 by the order of the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], in response to the successful airborne operations conducted by the German military during the [[Battle of France]]. Training began immediately, but a shortage of proper equipment and training facilities, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, meant that only a small number of volunteers could immediately be trained as parachute troops. The first airborne unit to be formed was actually a re-trained [[British Commandos|Commando]] unit, [[No. 2 Commando]], which was subsequently renamed as No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion and numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks by September 1940. The battalion finished its training in December 1940, and in February 1941 thirty-eight members of the battalion, known as X Troop, were selected to conduct an airborne operation, which was intended to test the capability of the airborne troops and their equipment, as well as the ability of the [[Royal Air Force]] to accurately deliver them.	|||		|||		|||

During the course of the interdiction operation, an air battle known as the 18 April ''Palmsonntag Massaker'' ('Palm Sunday Massacre') took place, in which the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport fleets suffered heavy losses over [[Cape Bon]], while evacuating ''Heer'' forces escaping from the Allied ground offensive [[Operation Vulcan|Operation ''Vulcan'']]. The air operation continued until 27 April. The operation destroyed Axis logistical support. Along with the attempted airlift during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Operation Flax inflicted such grievous losses on the German transport fleets that they were unable to recover.	|||		|||		|||
0	Operation Flax	|||	Second Battle of El Alamein	|||	In November 1942, American and British forces landed in North Africa under [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']]. Allied thrusts overran [[Vichy French]] [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] and advanced into [[Tunisia]]. The danger for the [[Axis Powers]] was now apparent. The Allied forces advancing eastward and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]] advancing westward after the victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], would trap and destroy the remaining Axis forces in North Africa. In response to the crisis, and the poor state of Axis forces, reinforcements for the German ''[[Afrika Korps]]'', [[Italian Army]] and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' were dispatched by sea and air. These reinforcements duly staved off an immediate defeat in Tunisia, the last region still in Axis hands. The poor state of the roads and rail lines in Algeria meant that Allied forces faced difficult [[Military logistics|logistic]] challenges which enabled the Axis to prolong a defence. The inexperience of U.S. forces was also apparent at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]]. Nevertheless, the growing number and experience of Allied forces squeezed the Axis toward the northern tip of Tunisia. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Royal Navy]] operating from [[Malta]] took a heavy toll of Axis shipping. However, Axis supplies were still reaching the besieged ''Afrika Korps'' by air. By early April, large quantities of Axis manpower was also being evacuated by air. Although the Allies held [[air superiority]] by this time, ''Luftwaffe'' transports were operating with impunity during darkness.	|||		|||		|||

0	Operation Goodwood	|||	Operation Cobra	|||	When Operation Goodwood ended on 20 July, the armoured divisions had broken through the initial German defences and had advanced seven miles before coming to a halt in front of the Bourguébus Ridge, with armoured cars having penetrated even further south and over the ridge. The objective of the operation was a limited attack to secure Caen and the Bourguébus Ridge beyond, pinning German formations in the eastern region of the Normandy beachhead. This prevented German forces disengaging and moving south to confront US forces in their breakout operation, [[Operation Cobra]], which began on 25 July.  At least one historian has called the operation the largest tank battle that the British Army has ever fought.	|||		|||		|||

Following months of preparations, a successful attack ([[Operation Tungsten]]) involving two strike forces of 20 [[Fairey Barracuda]] dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters was conducted on 3 April 1944. While ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged.	|||	Background	|||		|||

Several plans were considered in 1915 and 1916, then shelved due to operations elsewhere. Operation Hush was intended to begin when the main offensive at Ypres had advanced to Roulers and Thourout, linked by advances by the French and Belgian armies in between. Operation {{lang|de|''Strandfest''}} was a German spoiling attack, conducted on 10 July by [[Naval Corps (German Empire)|Marinekorps-Flandern]], in anticipation of an Allied coastal operation.	|||		|||		|||

The LTTE withdrew to the jungles of the [[Wanni]] from where in 1996 they launched an attack on an isolated [[Sri Lanka Army]] (SLA) garrison in [[Mullaitivu]]. After the [[Battle of Mullaitivu (1996)|Battle of Mullaitivu]] the LTTE gained control over the Mullaitivu district, since the government did not reestablish a base due to the lack of a land supply route to it. Instead, at the request of the deputy minister of defence, General Anurudha Ratwatte, the military forces began to plan a large scale operation to open a land route to Jaffna.	|||	Background	|||		|||

On 11 July, counter-attacks by the {{lang|de|''[[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS-Panzer Division]]''}} and the [[102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion]] in the afternoon, forced the British off the top of Hill 112, to positions on the north-facing slope. The operation was a tactical failure for VIII Corps but a strategic success for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], attrition having reduced the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] to a condition from which it never recovered. Several other British operations were [[Second Battle of the Odon|conducted in the Odon valley]] during July and the [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] occupied Hill 112 almost unopposed on 4 August, after the Germans withdrew during [[Operation Cobra]] and [[Operation Bluecoat]] further west. A stone memorial to the 43rd Division was built on the hill in the late 1940s.	|||		|||		|||

Some obvious similarities exist between Siachen and Kargil, including their preemptive nature and the tactical advantage held by the entity who holds the heights. But while Operation ''Meghdoot'' was launched in an area of ambiguous border demarcation, the [[Line of Control]] in the [[Kargil District|Kargil region]] is clearly demarcated and therefore India received complete international support during the Kargil episode.	|||	 Aftermath 	|||		|||
0	Operation Mincemeat	|||	Battle of Kursk	|||	German defensive efforts were substantially redirected: reinforcements were sent to Greece, [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]] instead of Sicily. British commando activities had also been carried out in Greece. The renowned general [[Erwin Rommel]] was sent to Greece to assume overall command. A group of '[[R boat]]s' (German minesweepers and minelayers) was transferred from Sicily, and three additional minefields were laid off the Greek coast. Three [[panzer]] divisions were moved to Greece – one from France, and two from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The latter was perhaps the most critical move – reducing German combat strength in the [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk salient]] (influencing events on the Eastern Front was apparently neither intended nor foreseen by the British originators of the plan, who were preoccupied with their own part of the war).  The Italian navy was also positioned in the general regional area of and around Greek waters, in preparatory advance to the defense of the anticipated upcoming Allied invasion of Greece.	|||	'Mincemeat swallowed rod, line and sinker'	|||		|||

Days after commencement of the offensive, the VRS positions to the right and to the left of the HV and the HVO advance were also attacked by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine'' – ARBiH) in [[Operation Sana]].

A failed counterattack by German forces on 8 August led to 50,000 soldiers of the German 7th Army being trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]]. The Allies launched an invasion of southern France ([[Operation Dragoon]]) on 15 August, and the [[Liberation of Paris]] followed on 25 August.

In the same period, only 31 MiGs were shot down by US aircraft and things worsened in the summer with 13 US aircraft lost to MiGs and only 11 MiGs shot down.

Rabaul's strategic location, multiple airfields and large natural harbor made it the ideal staging base for ships, aircraft, troops and supplies during the [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]] campaigns.  After the Japanese lost their hold on Guadalcanal in early 1943, Allied forces began the push up the Solomon Islands to Rabaul. [[Marine Raiders]] and US Army troops landed on the [[Russell Islands]] shortly after, and an airbase was established there. US forces then pushed the Japanese out of the [[New Georgia Campaign|New Georgia]] island group in August 1943. Here, the Japanese command had invested men and supplies into building an airfield at Munda, all of which proved to be a waste.

Official documentation and eyewitnesses within the Paris police department indeed suggest that the massacre was directed by Papon. Police records show that Papon called for officers in one station to be 'subversive' in quelling the demonstrations, and assured them protection from prosecution if they participated.  Many demonstrators died when they were violently herded by police into the [[River Seine]], with some thrown from bridges after being beaten unconscious. Other demonstrators were killed within the courtyard of the Paris police headquarters after being arrested and delivered there in police buses. Officers who participated in the courtyard killings took the precaution of removing identification numbers from their uniforms, while senior officers ignored pleas by other policemen who were shocked when witnessing the brutality. Silence about the events within the police headquarters was further enforced by threats of reprisals from participating officers.	|||		|||		|||

By 8 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the now counterattacking Bulgarian armies, and the Bulgarian General Staff, attempting to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle was applying pressure on their flanks.  At 15 July, the Bulgarian army, under heavy pressure, was forced to abandon Gorna Dzhumaya.	|||	Greek offensive	|||		|||
0	Second Balkan War	|||	First Balkan War	|||	The '''Second Balkan War''' was a conflict which broke out when [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], dissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the [[First Balkan War]], attacked its former allies, [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], on 16 ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/29 June 1913. Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked, entering Bulgaria. With Bulgaria also having previously engaged in territorial disputes with [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], this war provoked Romanian intervention against Bulgaria. The [[Ottoman Empire]] also took advantage of the situation to regain some lost territories from the [[First Balkan War|previous war]]. When Romanian troops approached the capital [[Sofia]], Bulgaria asked for an armistice, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], in which Bulgaria had to cede portions of its First Balkan War gains to Serbia, Greece and Romania. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1913)|Treaty of Constantinople]], it lost [[Edirne]] to the Ottomans.	|||		|||		|||
0	Second Battle of Amman	|||	Battle of Megiddo (1918)	|||	The '''Second Battle of Amman''' was fought on 25 September 1918 during the [[Third Transjordan attack]] as part of the [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Battle of Nablus]] which together with the main [[Battle of Sharon]] form the major set piece offensive known as the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] in World War I. After cutting the road from Nablus to [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]] on 22 September [[Chaytor's Force]] captured the bridge over the [[Jordan River]] at [[Capture of Jisr ed Damieh|Jisr ed Damieh]] while units of the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]] and remnants of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] were still in retreating towards the bridge from the [[Judean Hills]]. Having cut this line of retreat, Chaytor's Force proceeded eastwards to attack and capture Es Salt, before riding on to attack and capture the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rearguard of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth Army]] defending [[Amman]]. These [[British Empire]] victories of the Third Transjordan attack over [[Yildirim Army Group]] forces, followed two unsuccessful EEF attacks across the Jordan River in [[First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918)|March]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|April]] 1918.	|||		|||		|||

0	Second Battle of El Alamein	|||	Battle of Stalingrad	|||	Rommel knew full well that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to launch an offensive against his army. His only hope now relied on the German forces fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] to quickly defeat the Soviet forces and moving south through the [[Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and threatening Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. This would require large numbers of British Commonwealth forces to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce British forces in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Using this delay, Rommel hoped to convince the German High Command to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between ''Panzer'' Army Africa and the German armies battling their way through southern Russia, enabling them to finally defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.	|||	Prelude	|||	Axis plan	|||
0	Second Battle of El Alamein	|||	Eastern Front (World War II)	|||	With the failure of their offensive at Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces were now on the defensive, but losses had not been excessive. The German and Italian supply lines were over-stretched and had been relying on captured Allied supplies and equipment that had long since been consumed. Rommel had been advised by both the German and Italian staffs that his army could not be properly supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and Benghazi. Despite these warnings, Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, the supply echelons could not deliver the required supplies from the ports to the front.  On the other hand, the British Commonwealth forces were being re-supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the newly-introduced Sherman tanks from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel, but the main focus of the German war machine was on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and very limited supplies reached North Africa.	|||	Prelude	|||	Axis plan	|||

0	Second Battle of the Aisne	|||	Battle of Cambrai (1917)	|||	The British prolonged the Arras offensive into mid-May, despite uncertainty about French intentions, high losses and diminishing success, before moving their forces northwards to Flanders. The British captured [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]] on 7 June and spent the rest of the year on the offensive in the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] ({{nowrap|31 July – 10 November}}) and the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] ({{nowrap|20 November – 8 December}}). The French conducted limited attacks at Verdun in August, which recaptured much of the remaining ground lost in 1916 and at Malmaison in October, which captured the west end of the Chemin des Dames and forced the Germans to withdraw from the ridge to the north bank of [[Ailette (river)|the Ailette]].

There they established two independent Boer republics: the South African Republic (1852; also known as the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State (1854). The British recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854, but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the [[First Boer War]] in 1880–81.

This led [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], the prime minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, to attempt to establish relations with other European powers, partially through Piedmont's participation in the [[Crimean War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace conference]] at [[Paris]] following the Crimean War, Cavour attempted to bring attention to efforts for Italian unification. He found Britain and France to be sympathetic, but entirely unwilling to go against Austrian wishes, as any movement towards Italian independence would necessarily threaten Austria's territory in [[Lombardy]] and [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]]. Private talks between Napoleon III and Cavour after the conference identified Napoleon as the most likely, albeit still uncommitted, candidate for aiding Italy.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping–Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July–August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, which was signed after Japan invaded China during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and engaged in [[Boxer Rebellion#Occupation, looting, and atrocities|atrocities and massacres against civilians]], participated in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans).  The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts.  As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]], as it came to be called, strongly shook public opinion within Japan.

0	Siege of Detroit	|||	Battle of Queenston Heights	|||	The British gained an important post on American territory and won control over Michigan Territory and the Detroit region for most of the following year. Brock was hailed as a hero, and Tecumseh's influence over the confederation of natives was strengthened. Brock left Colonel Henry Procter in command at Amherstburg and Detroit, and went to the Niagara River, intending to mount a pre-emptive attack into New York State to forestall an American attack across the river. He was thwarted by an armistice arranged by [[George Prevost|Sir George Prevost]]. This ended in September. The Americans attacked in October near [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]]. At the ensuing [[Battle of Queenston Heights]], Brock was killed leading a hasty counter-attack to recover a battery which had been captured by the Americans. The American troops in the attack were taken prisoner. A third invasion of Canada took place in November to capture Montreal. After accidentally firing on each other in the dark, they gave up and returned without even crossing the border. 'The whole Canadian campaign had produced nothing but “disaster, defeat, disgrace, and ruin and death,” the Green-Mountain Farmer, a Vermont newspaper, reported in January 1813.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

In the [[Battle of Longue-Pointe]], this effort failed on the next day, with Allen and a number of men captured by the British.	|||	Siege begins	|||		|||
0	Siege of Fort Wayne	|||	Battle of the Thames	|||	The defeats at the [[Battle of Fort Harrison]] and at Fort Wayne caused many Native Americans to lose confidence in their chiefs.  Many of them turned instead to the influential leadership of [[Tecumseh]] and joined his confederacy.  No major Indian attacks occurred in the [[Indiana Territory]] for the rest of the war, but it was not until Tecumseh's defeat at the [[Battle of the Thames]] that the Indian threat was really eliminated.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Fort Wayne	|||	Siege of Detroit	|||	Since 1811, after the severe defeat at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], Native American tribes on the Northwest frontier had been growing bitter at the U.S. presence there.  Encouraged by other British/Native American victories at places such as [[Battle of Fort Dearborn|Fort Dearborn]] and [[Siege of Detroit|Detroit]], native tribes began to undertake campaigns against other smaller American outposts.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Siege of Fredriksten	|||	Battle of Dynekilen	|||	Charles' troops attempted to take Frederiksten by storm on July 4. His troops took the town after fierce fighting, but the citizens set fire to their own houses, forcing Charles, unable to take the fortress, to retreat and await the arrival of heavy siege guns. Unfortunately for the invading army the entire Swedish transport fleet was captured or destroyed by the Norwegian naval hero [[Tordenskjold]] at the [[Battle of Dynekilen]] in Bohuslen. Running low on supplies, Charles retreated hastily across the [[Svinesund]] and burned the bridges behind him. By July 12, 1716 all Swedish troops had been withdrawn from the area around Fredriksten.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||
0	Siege of Hull (1643)	|||	Battle of Marston Moor	|||	On 11 October, the Royalists had been defeated at the [[Battle of Winceby]] in Lincolnshire. These two defeats ended Royalist hopes of advancing on London and threw them on the defensive. The Parliamentarians began their advance into Yorkshire that was to culminate with Newcastle being [[siege of York|besieged in York]] and the consequent [[Battle of Marston Moor]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

After the capitulation, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed Fürstenberg as [[Proprietor (Inhaber)|Colonel and Proprietor]] of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, which bore his name until his death in [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|battle]] in 1799.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Hüningen (1796–97)	|||	Battle of Tourcoing	|||	On 20 April 1792, the [[French National Convention]] declared war on Austria. In this [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Coalition forces achieved several victories at [[Battle of Verdun (1792)|Verdun]], [[Battle of Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]], [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]], but these were countered by French victories at [[Battle of Tourcoing|Tourcouring (1794)]], [[Siege of Dunkirk (1793)|Dunkirk]], and [[Battle of Haguenau (1793)|Haguenau]]. For the French, the [[Rhine Campaign of 1795]] proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795)]].	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Siege of Kraków (1655)	|||	Battle of Wojnicz	|||	On September 25, the Swedes attacked [[Kazimierz]], pillaging it after capture. On the same day, they tried to enter Krakow itself, but Polish counterattack forced them to retreat. On the next day, Charles Gustav ordered an artillery barrage, leaving Arvid Wittenberg with 8,000 soldiers. The Swedish king himself headed with a smaller army towards Wojnicz, where he once again defeated the Poles in the [[Battle of Wojnicz]] (October 3). News of this battle quickly reached Krakow, together with Swedish demands for capitulation. Since Polish royal army units, scattered around the city, did not engage themselves in any skirmishes with the Swedes, the defenders of Krakow felt abandoned, without hope of any support. Nevertheless, they continued to fight.	|||	 The Siege 	|||		|||
0	Siege of Kut	|||	Battle of Alesia	|||	The pursuing Ottoman forces arrived on 7 December 1915.  Once it became clear the Ottomans had enough forces to lay siege to Kut, Townshend ordered his cavalry to escape south, which it did, led by [[Gerard Leachman|Lieut. Colonel Gerard Leachman DSO]].  The Ottoman forces numbered around 11,000 men and increasing steadily with additional reinforcements arriving constantly, were commanded by the respected but elderly German general and military historian [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]].  Goltz knew the Ottoman army well, as he had spent 12 years working on modernizing the Ottoman army from 1883 to 1895.  After three attacks in December, Goltz directed the building of siege fortifications facing Kut.  Like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] at the [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]],{{OR|date=August 2014}} he prepared for an attack from Basra, using the [[Tigris River]], by building defensive positions further down the river designed to cut off a river-borne relief.	|||	The siege	|||		|||

There were four [[Victoria Cross]]es awarded during the siege, [[John Norwood]] on 30 October 1899. At Wagon Hill on 6 January 1900, [[Herman Albrecht]] and [[Robert James Thomas Digby-Jones]] (who both died), and [[James Edward Ignatius Masterson]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Leningrad	|||	Battle of Stalingrad	|||	The 872 days of the siege caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of up to 1,500,000  [[Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery]] alone in Leningrad holds half a million civilian victims of the siege. Economic destruction and human losses in Leningrad on both sides exceeded those of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the [[Battle of Moscow]], or the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. The siege of Leningrad is the [[Most lethal battles in world history|most lethal siege in world history]], and some historians speak of the siege operations in terms of [[genocide]], as a 'racially motivated starvation policy' that became an integral part of the unprecedented German war of extermination against populations of the Soviet Union generally.	|||	Effect on the city	|||		|||
0	Siege of Leningrad	|||	Russian Revolution	|||	The capture of Leningrad was one of three strategic goals in the German [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the main target of Army Group North. The strategy was motivated by [[Leningrad]]'s political status as the former capital of [[Russia]] and the symbolic capital of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], its military importance as a main base of the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]] and its industrial strength, housing numerous arms factories.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Siege of Leningrad	|||	Winter War	|||	By August 1941, the Finns had advanced to within 20 km of the northern suburbs of Leningrad at the 1939 Finnish-Soviet border, threatening the city from the north; they were also advancing through [[East Karelia]], east of Lake Ladoga, and threatening the city from the east. The Finnish forces crossed the pre-[[Winter War]] border on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] by eliminating Soviet [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salients]] at Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, thus straightening the frontline so that it ran along the old border near the shores of Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and those positions closest to Leningrad still lying on the pre-Winter War border. According to Soviet claims, the Finnish advance was stopped in September through resistance by the [[Karelian Fortified Region]];	|||	Establishment	|||	Finnish participation	|||
0	Siege of Louisbourg (1758)	|||	Battle of Cartagena (1758)	|||	As they had in 1757, the French planned to defend Louisbourg by a large naval build-up. However, the French fleet sailing from [[Toulon]] was blockaded in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] by a British force, and a relief force was defeated at the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]]. After this the French abandoned their attempt to reinforce Louisbourg from the Mediterranean, meaning there would be few ships available to actively oppose the British off Louisbourg.	|||	Background	|||		|||
0	Siege of Lyme Regis	|||	Battle of Lostwithiel	|||	Maurice retreated to Exeter, while the Earl of Essex continued down into [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], after sending Blake to [[Sieges of Taunton|capture Taunton]]. Essex's campaign failed, suffering a total defeat at the [[Battle of Lostwithiel]] in early September 1644. His remaining forces retreated back to Dorset, leaving only Plymouth, Lyme Regis and Taunton under Parliamentarian control in the south-west.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Siege of Mafeking	|||	Jameson Raid	|||	Like the British government, the local politicians feared that increased military activity might provoke a Boer attack, so Baden-Powell decided to obtain many of his own stores, organise his own transport and recruit in secret. With barely trained forces and aware of the Boers' greatly superior numbers, [[commando]] tactics and the failure of the earlier [[Jameson Raid]], Baden-Powell decided that the best way to tie down Boer troops would be through defence rather than attack. Consequently, he chose to hold the town of Mafeking due to its location - both near the border and on the railway between [[Bulawayo]] and [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] - and because of its status as a local administrative centre. As well, the town had good stocks of food and other necessities.	|||	 Prelude 	|||		|||
0	Siege of Malta (World War II)	|||	Operation Pedestal	|||	In August, [[Operation Pedestal]] brought vital relief to the besieged island, but at heavy cost. It was attacked from the sea, but also by air. Some 146 Ju 88s, 72 Bf 109s, 16 Ju 87s, 232 Italian fighters, and 139 Italian bombers (a large number being the highly effective torpedo bomber the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]) took part in the action against the convoy.{{sfn|Spooner|1996|p= 179}} Out of the 14 merchant ships sent, nine were sunk. Moreover, the [[aircraft carrier]] HMS ''Eagle'', one cruiser and three destroyers were sunk by a combined effort from the Italian Navy, ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe''.

In 1845, although the population was almost entirely [[Muslim|Moslem]], it was ruled by a [[Hindu]] vassal, [[Dewan Mulraj]]. In that year, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] broke out, and was won by the British East India Company. There was an uneasy peace for three years, during which Mulraj attempted to maintain practical independence while being nominally subject to the East India Company.	|||	Background	|||		|||

Approximately 38,000 people have been awarded (servicemen of the Soviet Army, Navy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and civil citizens who took part in the defense of Odessa). [[Odessa]] was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of '[[Hero City]]' in 1945 (the others being [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Sevastopol]]).	|||	Soviet Recognition of the Defenders of Odessa	|||		|||

Benjamin L. Farinholt, dug in with earthworks and prepared artillery positions at the bridge. The [[Battle of Staunton River Bridge]] was a minor affair in which Kautz attempted multiple frontal assaults against the Home Guard, but his men never came closer than {{convert|80|yd|m}}. Lee's cavalry division closed on the Federals from the northeast and skirmished with Wilson's rear guard. Casualties on the Union side amounted to 42 killed, 44 wounded, and 30 missing or captured; Confederate losses were 10 killed and 24 wounded. Kautz's men gave up and retreated to the railroad depot at 9 p.m. Despite these relatively minor losses, the two Union cavalry generals decided to abandon their mission, leaving the Staunton River bridge intact and having inflicted only minor damage on the railroads.	|||	Initial attempts to cut the railroads (June 21–30)	|||	Wilson-Kautz Raid (June 22 – July 1) {{anchor|Wilson-Kautz}}	|||

0	Siege of Savannah	|||	Capture of Savannah	|||	The '''Siege of Savannah''' or the '''Second Battle of Savannah''' was an encounter of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1779. The year before, the city of [[Savannah, Georgia]], had been [[Capture of Savannah|captured]] by a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] expeditionary corps under [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]]. The siege itself consisted of a joint [[Franco-American alliance|Franco-American]] attempt to retake Savannah, from September 16 to October 18, 1779. On October 9 a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, Polish nobleman Count [[Casimir Pułaski]], leading the combined [[cavalry]] forces on the American side, was mortally wounded. With the failure of the joint American-French attack, the [[siege]] failed, and the British remained in control of Savannah until July 1782, near the end of the war.	|||		|||		|||

The [[French Royal Army (1652–1830)|French Royal Army]] was unable to break down Turin's defences or obtain the city's surrender. The besiegers were attacked on 7 September by a [[Habsburg Austria]]n relief column under [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy]] and routed at the '''Battle of the Stura'''. The siege of Turin was broken and the withdrawal of French forces from northern [[Italy]] began.

Having weakened the Ottoman defences which had stretched almost continually from Gaza to Beersheba, they were finally captured by 8 November, after the [[Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe]], the [[Battle of Hareira and Sheria]] and the [[Third Battle of Gaza]], when the pursuit began. During the subsequent operations, about {{convert|50|mi|km}} of formerly Ottoman territory, was captured as a result of the EEF victories at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], fought between 10 and 14 November, and the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Battle of Jerusalem]] fought between 17 November and 30 December. Serious losses on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in March 1918 during [[Erich Ludendorff]]'s German [[Spring Offensive]], forced the British Empire to send reinforcements from the EEF. During this time, two unsuccessful attacks were made [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|to capture Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|to capture Es Salt]] in March and April 1918, before Allenby's force resumed the offensive during the [[manoeuvre warfare]] of the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]].

Serious losses on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in March 1918 during [[Erich Ludendorff]]'s German [[Spring Offensive]], forced the British Empire to send reinforcements from the EEF. During this time, two unsuccessful attacks were made [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|to capture Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|to capture Es Salt]] in March and April 1918, before Allenby's force resumed the offensive during the [[manoeuvre warfare]] of the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. The successful infantry battles at [[Battle of Tulkarm|Tulkarm]] and [[Battle of Tabsor|Tabsor]] created gaps in the Ottoman front line, allowing the pursuing [[Desert Mounted Corps]] to [[encirclement|encircle]] the infantry fighting in the [[Judean Hills]] and fight the [[Battle of Nazareth]] and [[Battle of Samakh]], capturing [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah, Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin|Jenin]] and [[Capture of Tiberias|Tiberias]].

0	Sino-Vietnamese War	|||	Fall of Saigon	|||	The United States played an ever-increasing role in supporting South Vietnam through the period. The U.S. had supported French forces in the First Indochina War, sent supplies and military advisers to South Vietnam throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and eventually took over most of the fighting against both North Vietnam and the Viet Cong by the mid-1960s. By 1968, over 500,000 American troops were involved in the Vietnam War. Due to a lack of clear military success and facing [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|increasingly strident opposition]] to the war in the U.S., American forces began a slow withdrawal in 1969 while attempting to [[Vietnamization|bolster South Vietnam's military]] so that they could take over the fighting. In accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] by 29 March 1973 all U.S. combat forces had left South Vietnam, however North Vietnamese combat forces were allowed to remain in place.

The only realistic option would be to restart the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|unresolved border conflict with China]]. Vietnam was important to Soviet policy but not enough for the Soviets to go to war over. When Moscow did not intervene, Beijing publicly proclaimed that the Soviet Union had broken its numerous promises to assist Vietnam.	|||	Course of the war	|||	Chinese withdrawal	|||

After two and a half months of fierce fighting, 12,000 U.S. servicemen, 107,000 Japanese soldiers, and at least 150,000 Okinawan civilians were killed. Given the casualty rate in Okinawa, American commanders realized the true grisly picture of what would have happened if hundreds of thousands of its men stormed the Japanese home islands and penetrating though Japanese heavy defenses by fighting house-to-house, cave-to-cave, setting up trenches in unsaturated areas to defend against Japanese attacks, etc. When President [[Harry Truman]] was briefed on what would have happened during the invasion of Japan, he could not afford such a horrendous casualty rate, let alone the fact that over 400,000 U.S. servicemen died fighting in both the European and Pacific theaters of the war.	|||	Asia	|||	United States bombing of Japan	|||	Nuclear bombing

0	Tondern raid	|||	Battle of Taranto	|||	The German Naval Airship Division quickly had the double hangar Toska repaired, but Tondern was abandoned as an active base, and ordered to be used only as an emergency landing site. Defences at the other bases were improved and at [[Nordholz]] a swathe of the countryside near [[Nordholz Naval Airbase|the local airbase]] was burned off so as to prevent it being set alight by enemy bombs.  The British conducted no other carrier raids during the war but other raids were being planned. From 1917 onwards a raid on the German High Seas Fleet was being mooted using the new torpedo-carrying [[Sopwith Cuckoo]]. The Cuckoo was not available in sufficient numbers until early 1919 and the project was still-born. The concept was revived during the Second World War and eventually resulted in the successful [[Battle of Taranto|raid on the Italian port of Taranto]] in 1940.	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||
0	Tyrolean Rebellion	|||	Battle of Wagram	|||	The Tyroleans celebrated the news that Napoleon had suffered his first defeat at the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] on May 22. Nevertheless, after the French again gained the upper hand at the [[Battle of Wagram]] on July 5/6, [[Archduke Charles of Austria]] signed the [[Armistice of Znaim]] whereafter the Austrian forces withdraw from Tyrol. Thus, the rebels, who had their strongholds in Southern Tyrol, were left fighting alone. They however were able to inflict several defeats to the French and Bavarians forces under Marshal Lefebvre in July, culminating in a complete French retreat after the [[Battles of Bergisel|Third Battle of Bergisel]] on August 12/13. Hofer now took over the administration of the unoccupied territories at Innsbruck; large parts of Tyrol enjoyed a brief period of independence.	|||	 The war of the Fifth Coalition and outbreak and course of the rebellion 	|||		|||

The protesters' slogan, ''[[We are the 99%]]'', refers to the growing [[income inequality in the United States|difference in wealth]] in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. The protests grew into a world-wide movement known as the [[Occupy movement]] and make use of a variety of [[civil disobedience]] tactics.

0	Ukrainian War of Independence	|||	Kerensky Offensive	|||	The [[February Revolution]] of 1917 encouraged many ethnic groups in the Russian Empire to demand greater autonomy and various degrees of [[self-determination]]. A month later, the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] was declared in [[Kiev]] as an autonomous entity with close ties to the [[Russian Provisional Government]], and governed by a [[socialist]]-dominated [[Central Council of Ukraine|Tsentralna Rada]] ('Central Council'). The weak and ineffective Provisional Government in [[Petrograd]] continued its loyalty to the entente and the increasingly unpopular war, launching the [[Kerensky Offensive]] in the summer of 1917. This Offensive was a complete disaster for the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. The German counter-attack caused Russia to lose all their gains of 1916, as well as destroy the [[morale]] of its army, which caused the near-complete disintegration of the armed forces and the governing apparatus all over the vast Empire. Many deserting soldiers and officers – particularly ethnic Ukrainians – had lost faith in the future of the Empire, and found the increasingly self-determinant Central Rada a much more favourable alternative. [[Nestor Makhno]] began his [[Anarchist Manifesto|anarchist activity]] in the south of Ukraine by disarming deserting Russian soldiers and officers who crossed the [[Gaychur River]] next to [[Huliaipole|Gulyai Pole]], while in the east in the industrial [[Donets Basin]] there were frequent strikes by [[Bolshevik]]-infiltrated [[trade union]]s.	|||	Background	|||		|||

After five years of war, the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] subdued the [[First Coalition]] in 1797. A [[Second Coalition]] was formed in 1798 but this too was defeated by 1801. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] remained the only opponent for the new [[French Consulate]]. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of [[Malta]].  In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.	|||	Prelude	|||		|||

The Russians withdrew to the northeast to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on November 12. On December 2, the decisive French victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] removed Austria from the war. The resulting [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in late December brought the Third Coalition to an end and left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Russia the following year.	|||		|||		|||

It was held from Friday, October 31 to Wednesday, December 3, 1800. In what is sometimes referred to as the ''''Revolution of 1800''','  Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] defeated President [[John Adams]]. The election was a [[realigning election]] that ushered in a generation of [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] rule and the eventual demise of the [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist Party]] in the [[First Party System]]. It was a long, bitter re-match of the 1796 election between the pro-French and pro-decentralization Democratic-Republicans under Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]], against incumbent Adams and Charles Pinckney's pro-British and pro-centralization Federalists.  The chief political issues included opposition to the tax imposed by Congress to pay for the mobilization of the new army and the navy in the [[Quasi-War]] against France in 1798, and the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], by which Federalists were trying to stifle dissent, especially by Democratic-Republican newspaper editors.	|||		|||		|||

0	Upper Canada Rebellion	|||	Patriot War	|||	The '''Upper Canada Rebellion''' was an insurrection against the [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] government of the British colony of [[Upper Canada]] (present day [[Ontario]]) in December 1837. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Rebellion]] in [[Lower Canada]] (present day [[Quebec]]) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly through the support of the [[Hunters' Lodges]], a secret anti-British, US-based militia that emerged around the [[Great Lakes]]. They launched the [[Patriot War]] in 1838-39.  The rebellion led directly to [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]]'s [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]] and to ''[[Act of Union 1840|The British North America Act, 1840]]'' which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system. Some historians argue that the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late 18th and early 19th century [[Atlantic Revolutions|Atlantic revolutions]]. The [[American Revolutionary war]] in 1776, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789–1799, the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791-1804, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the independence struggles of Spanish America (1810–1825) were inspired by similar democratic ideals, although they were tinged with [[republicanism]] as well.

0	Wesley Clark presidential campaign, 2004	|||	Iraq War	|||	Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush [[tax cut]]s for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new [[universal health care]] system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse 'scaled down rules' the Bush administration had applied to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air]] and [[Clean Water Act]]s and dealing with [[global warming]] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the [[USA PATRIOT Act|PATRIOT Act]], and investing $100 billion in [[homeland security]]. Finally, he put out a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the [[Bush tax cuts]], sharing the cost of the [[Iraq War]] with other nations, and cutting government waste.	|||	Campaign	|||		|||

He first marched on [[Dublin]], where he was well received and, with a Jacobite army of Catholics, Protestant Royalists and French, then marched north, joining the [[Siege of Derry]] on 18 April. James found himself leading a predominantly Irish Catholic movement, and on 7 May he presided over an Irish Parliament composed almost entirely of Catholic gentry.  He reluctantly agreed to the Parliament's demand for an Act declaring that the Parliament of England had no right to pass laws for Ireland. He also agreed, again reluctantly, to restore to Irish Catholics the lands confiscated from their families after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], by confiscating the lands of those (predominantly Protestants) who opposed him and supported William. This parliament was later named the [[Patriot Parliament]] by Irish nationalists.	|||	Campaign in Ulster	|||		|||

However, they also needed to coordinate their actions with [[Spain]], where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of [[Jamaica]].

Initially, Kurdish movements were trying to align with the new government of Iran, seeking to emphasize their Muslim identity and seek common grounds with the Shia's. KDPI even briefly branded itself as non-'separatist' organization, allegedly criticizing those calling for independence, but nevertheless calling for political autonomy.  The relations however quickly deteriorated between the Kurds and the new Islamic government, and though Shi'a Kurds and some tribal leaders turned towards the new Shi'a Islamic State, Sunni Kurdish leftists continued the nationalist project in their enclave in Kurdistan Province. Denise, N. ''The Kurds And the State: Evolving National Identity in Iraq, Turkey, And Iran'':p.145 2005. Siracuse University Press. 'Instead of creating a cohesive Kurdish nationalist movement, some Kurdish leaders such as Husayni's brother Shaykh Jalal accepted Iraqi military assistance and formed a Sunni militia opposed to the Iranian government and Kurdish nationalist parties. Qasimlu differentiated his real Kurdish nationalist party from traitors within the KDPI. Others, such as the prominent Ghani Bolourian, tried to negotiate with the central government. After the revolution some Shi'a Kurds from Ilam, Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan turned away from Kurdish nationalists and towards non-Kurdish Shi'a communities. Sunni Kurdish leftists continued to direct the nationalist project in their enclave in Kurdistan Province, having marginal influence over Shi'a Kurds in other regions.'	|||		|||		|||

A ceasefire (accorded to be in effect from 6 September 1991) had been agreed between the parts on July.  During August and the first days of September 1991, the Royal Moroccan Army (RMA) conducted offensive operations in the areas of [[Mehaires]], [[Tifariti]], [[Bir Lahlou]], [[Mijek]] and [[Agwanit]], resulting in multiple Sahrawi civilian casualties, the destruction of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, poisoning of the wells and subsequently depopulation of the area.	|||		|||		|||
1	1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia	|||	Croatian War of Independence	|||	The '''1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia''' was a series of engagements between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), the [[Yugoslav Navy]] and the [[Yugoslav Air Force]], and the [[Croatian National Guard]] (ZNG) then the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The JNA was originally deployed in order to preserve [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and the initial plan of the campaign entailed the military occupation of Croatia and the removal of the Croatian leadership [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|elected in 1990]]. The JNA intervention was the culmination of its involvement in the confiscation of weapons from Croatia's [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]], and in the [[Log revolution|Croatian Serb revolt]] that had begun in August 1990. From that time, the JNA had been frequently deployed to form a buffer zone between the insurgents and the ZNG or the Croatian police. In effect, these JNA buffer zones often secured the territorial gains of the insurgents and led to an increasingly hostile relationship between the JNA and Croatia. The JNA campaign plan was amended shortly before the campaign to include the relief of [[Battle of the Barracks|JNA barracks besieged by the ZNG]]. The besieging and subsequent capture of several JNA facilities allowed Croatia to arm its previously poorly equipped military and to equip new recruits.	|||		|||		|||

However, the arrangement proved short-lived as JNA units, again led by Mladić, attacked Kijevo and destroyed a substantial part of the village. The attack began when Croatian forces refused to surrender to Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]]. It was one of the first instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating [[Croatian War of Independence]].	|||	Aftermath	|||		|||

This announcement was accompanied by the doctrine of 'pre-emptive' military action, later termed the [[Bush Doctrine]]. Allegations of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were made by some [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] officials who asserted that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant organization al-Qaeda from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] (IIS). Some Bush advisers favored an immediate invasion of Iraq, while others advocated building an international coalition and obtaining United Nations authorization. Bush eventually decided to seek UN authorization, while still reserving the option of invading without it.	|||	Prelude to the invasion	|||		|||

They have been inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. Causes cited by the protestors include [[unemployment]], the lack of housing, food-price [[inflation]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and poor [[living conditions]]. While localised protests were already commonplace over previous years, extending into December 2010, an unprecedented wave of simultaneous protests and riots, sparked by sudden rises in staple food prices, erupted all over the country starting in January 2011.  These were quelled by government measures to lower food prices, but were followed by a wave of [[self-immolation]]s, most of them in front of government buildings.  Opposition parties, unions, and human rights organisations then began to hold weekly demonstrations, despite these being illegal without government permission under the ongoing [[state of emergency]]; the government suppressed these demonstrations as far as possible, but in late February yielded to pressure and lifted the state of emergency.  Meanwhile, protests by unemployed youth, typically citing unemployment, ''hogra'' (oppression), and infrastructure problems, resumed, occurring almost daily in towns scattered all over the country.	|||		|||		|||

The French squadron split up in the face of superior British numbers, the three vessels seeking to divide and outrun the British pursuit. One frigate, [[French frigate Gloire (1778)|''Gloire'']] was followed by the British frigate [[HMS Astraea (1781)|HMS ''Astraea'']] and was ultimately brought to battle in a closely fought engagement. Although the ships were roughly equal in size, the British ship was easily able to defeat the French in an engagement lasting just under an hour.	|||		|||		|||

The action occurred off [[Start Point, Devon|Start Point]] in Devon, when the British frigate [[HMS Nymphe (1780)|HMS ''Nymphe'']] encountered and chased the French frigate [[French frigate Cléopâtre|''Cléopâtre'']]. During the previous month, ''Cléopâtre'' and another frigate, [[French frigate Sémillante (1792)|''Sémillante'']], had been successfully raiding British merchant shipping in the [[English Channel]] and Eastern Atlantic from their base at [[Cherbourg]]. In response, the British frigates ''Nymphe'' and [[HMS Venus (1758)|HMS ''Venus'']] had been ordered to intercept and defeat the French frigates and on 27 May ''Venus'' and ''Sémillante'' fought an inconclusive engagement off [[Cape Finisterre]].	|||		|||		|||

During the Battle of Britain (and, indeed, the rest of the [[World War II|Second World War]]), both sides claimed to have shot down and destroyed more enemy aircraft on the ground and in the air than they had in reality. RAF Fighter Command claimed 78 German aircraft shot down on 13 August 1940.  Conversely, the ''Luftwaffe'' claimed to have destroyed 70 Hawker Hurricanes and Spitfires in the air and a further 18 Blenheim bombers in the air alone.

A small [[Japan]]ese force occupied the islands of [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], but the remoteness of the islands and the difficulties of weather and terrain meant that it took nearly a year for a far larger U.S./Canadian force to eject them. The islands' strategic value was their ability to control Pacific [[Great circle|Great Circle]] routes. This control of the Pacific transportation routes is why [[U.S. General]] [[Billy Mitchell]] stated to the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1935, 'I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.' The Japanese reasoned that control of the Aleutians would prevent a possible U.S. attack across the Northern Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. feared that the islands would be used as bases from which to launch aerial assaults against the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].	|||		|||		|||

Although Royal Navy dominance in the Western Atlantic had been established, French commerce raiders operating on short cruises were having a damaging effect on British trade, and British frigate squadrons regularly patrolled from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in search of the raiders. One such squadron comprised the 36-gun frigates [[HMS Unicorn (1794)|HMS ''Unicorn'']] and [[HMS Santa Margarita (1779)|HMS ''Santa Margarita'']], patrolling in the vicinity of the [[Scilly Isles]], which encountered a French squadron comprising the frigates [[HMS Tribune (1797)|''Tribune'']] and [[HMS Thames (1758)|''Tamise'']] and the [[corvette]] [[French corvette Légėre (1793)|''Légėre'']].	|||		|||		|||

The incident took place admidst the East Indies campaign of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] {{mdash}} repeated French attempts to disrupt the highly valuable British trade routes with [[British India]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]]. In 1796, a large squadron of French frigates arrived in the [[Indian Ocean]] under the command of [[Contre-amiral]] [[Pierre César Charles de Sercey]]. In July this force sailed on a [[commerce raiding]] cruise off [[British Ceylon]], but a subsequent attack into the [[Straits of Malacca]] was driven off in [[Action of 9 September 1796|an inconclusive engagement]] with two British [[ships of the line]] off Northeastern [[Sumatra]].

The Allies aimed to take [[Caen]], one of the largest cities in [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. Caen was an important Allied objective because it lay astride the [[Orne River]] and [[Canal de Caen à la Mer|Caen Canal]]; these two water obstacles could strengthen a German defensive position if not crossed.

Hessian General [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]], in command of the British garrison at [[New York City]], made an attempt to reach the principal [[Continental Army]] encampment at [[Morristown, New Jersey]].  Knyphausen's advance was strongly met by companies of the [[New Jersey]] militia at Connecticut Farms (present-day [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union Township]]).  After stiff resistance, the militia were forced to withdraw, but the battle and skirmishing that preceded it sufficiently delayed Knyphausen's advance that he remained there for the night.  After realizing that further advance on Morristown would probably be met by even more resistance, Knyphausen withdrew back toward New York.	|||		|||		|||

1	Battle of Corregidor (1945)	|||	Pacific War	|||	The surrender of Corregidor in 1942 and the ensuing grisly fate of its 11,000 American and Filipino defenders led to a particular sense of moral purpose in General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and as shown in the subsequent campaigns for the liberation of the Philippine archipelago, he showed no hesitation in committing the bulk of US and Philippine forces under his command. To the American soldier, Corregidor was more than a military objective; long before the campaign to recapture it, the ''Rock'' had become an important symbol in United States history as the last Pacific outpost of any size to fall to the enemy in the early stages of the [[Pacific War]].	|||		|||		|||

Six months after the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] ended the recent [[Irish War of Independence]], it was fought between [[National Army (Ireland)|the forces]] of the new [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]], and a section of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) who opposed the Treaty. The fighting began with an assault by Provisional Government forces on the [[Four Courts]] building, which had been occupied by the Anti-Treaty IRA, and ended in a decisive victory for the Provisional Government.	|||		|||		|||
1	Battle of Dunbar (1650)	|||	Wars of the Three Kingdoms	|||	Although the Scottish and English parliaments were initially allies in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], they did not remain so for the entire conflict. Differences in approaches to religion eventually came to the fore with the rise in power and influence of an [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] faction in the English Parliament, in particular its dominance of the [[New Model Army]] which alarmed the still Presbyterian-dominated Scottish Parliament. This was not what Scotland's Presbyterian commissioners had envisioned when they signed the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] along with their English counterparts. Thus there came a gradual realisation among some Covenanting Scots that a rapproachement or engagement with the King was perhaps the only way to achieve the 'true religion' throughout Britain. This idea was hotly contested in Scotland. Only a few were willing to act on such a proposal when the so-called [[Engagers]], unable to persuade the whole Covenanting movement of the wisdom of their strategy, decided they would show their compatriots the way through action rather than words. They invaded England in 1648 without the approval of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] or [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]]. However, the [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] proved to be a poor general and was easily defeated by the English parliamentary forces at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]]. After the defeat of the Engagers the opposing [[Kirk Party]] seized control of the wheels of government in Scotland, with the result that from this point on more power was held by Presbyterian ministers than by Presbyterian nobles such as the [[Earl of Argyll]]. Not surprisingly, with the declining power and influence of the moderately Royalist Presbyterians and the rise of the more militantly Covenanter Kirk Party, the Scottish government became even more overtly and rigidly Presbyterian. Those who had opposed engaging with the King in 1648 were now effectively governing Scotland. However, even the most militant of Covenanters realised that the English Parliament was never going to enact the [[Westminster Confession]] and that the only chance of their Presbyterianism being instituted throughout Britain was through its acceptance by the King. Thus it was that on 23 June 1650 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] landed in Scotland at [[Garmouth, Moray|Garmouth]] in [[Moray]] and by prior agreement, despite his [[Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic]] sympathies, signed on his arrival the [[Covenanter|1638 National Covenant]] and [[Solemn League and Covenant|1643 Solemn League and Covenant]] before being proclaimed [[King of Scots]]. This infuriated the English Parliament's [[Commonwealth of England|Council of State]] who decided on a pre-emptive invasion of Scotland. [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]], the Army's commander, disagreed with this strategy against Protestant 'brethren' and resigned; his generalship being taken by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] was made Sergeant Major General and appointed as the Army's second-in-command.	|||	Background	|||		|||
1	Battle of Ekeren	|||	War of the Spanish Succession	|||	The '''Battle of Ekeren''', June 30, 1703 was a battle of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

1	Battle of Elands River (1900)	|||	Second Boer War	|||	The '''Battle of Elands River''' was an engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] that took place between 4 and 16 August 1900 in western [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The battle was fought by the [[Elands River]] between a force of 2,000 to 3,000 [[Boer]]s who attacked a garrison of 500 Australian, [[Rhodesia]]n, Canadian and British soldiers, who were stationed at Brakfontein Drift near the Elands River to act as a garrison for a British supply dump. Over the course of 13 days, the garrison was heavily shelled and attacked with small arms. Outnumbered and surrounded, the garrison was asked to surrender, but refused. The siege was subsequently lifted when the garrison was relieved by a 10,000-strong column led by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]].	|||		|||		|||

1	Battle of Festubert	|||	Western Front (World War I)	|||	'''The Battle of Festubert''' (15–25 May 1915) was an attack by the [[British army]] in the Artois region of [[France]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]] during [[World War I]]. The offensive formed part of a series of attacks by the French Tenth Army and the British First Army in the [[Second Battle of Artois]] {{nowrap|(3 May – 18 June 1915)}}. After the failure of the attempted breakthrough by the First Army in the attack at Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915) tactics of a short hurricane bombardment and an infantry advance with unlimited objectives, were replaced by the French practice of slow and deliberate artillery-fire intended to prepare the way for an infantry attack. A continuous three-day bombardment by the British heavy artillery was planned, to cut wire and demolish German machine-gun posts and infantry strong-points. The German defences were to be captured by a continuous attack, by one division from Rue du Bois to Chocolat Menier Corner and by a second division {{convert|600|yd|m}} north, which was to capture the German trenches to the left of Festubert village. The objectives were {{convert|1000|yd|m}} forward, rather than the {{convert|3000|yd|m}} depth of advance intended at Aubers Ridge. The battle was the first British attempt at attrition.	|||		|||		|||
1	Battle of Fleurus (1794)	|||	French Revolutionary Wars	|||	The '''Battle of Fleurus''', on 26 June 1794, was a major engagement between the army of the [[First French Republic]], under General [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]], and the Coalition Army ([[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Hanover]], [[Dutch Republic]], and [[Habsburg Monarchy]]), commanded by [[Prince Josias of Coburg]], in the most decisive battle of the [[Flanders Campaign]] in the [[Low Countries]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Both sides had forces in the area numbering in the vicinity of 80,000 men, but the [[France|French]] were able to more effectively concentrate their troops in order to achieve victory against the [[First Coalition]]. The Allied defeat led to the permanent loss of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and to the destruction of the [[Dutch Republic]]. The battle marked a turning point for the French army which afterwards remained ascendant throughout the rest of the [[War of the First Coalition]].	|||		|||		|||
1	Battle of Fort Sumter	|||	American Civil War	|||	The '''Battle of Fort Sumter''' (April 12-14, 1861) was the [[bombardment]] and surrender of [[Fort Sumter]], near [[Charleston, South Carolina]], that started the [[American Civil War]]. Following declarations of [[secession]] by [[Confederate States of America#Secession|seven Southern states]], South Carolina demanded that the [[US Army]] abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, 1860, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable [[Fort Moultrie]] on [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]] to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship ''[[Star of the West]]'', failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area, except for Fort Sumter.	|||		|||		|||
1	Battle of France	|||	World War II	|||	The '''Battle of France''', also known as the '''Fall of France''', was the German invasion of [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], beginning on 10 May 1940, defeating primarily French forces. The battle consisted of two main operations. In the first, ''Fall Gelb'' (Case Yellow), German armoured units pushed through the [[Ardennes]] and then along the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] valley to cut off and [[Encirclement|surround]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] units that had advanced into Belgium. When British, Belgian and adjacent French forces were pushed back to the sea by the highly mobile and well-organized German operation, the British government decided to evacuate the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) as well as several French divisions at [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] in [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]].	|||		|||		|||
1	Battle of Fuengirola	|||	Peninsular War	|||	The town of [[Fuengirola]] has been an important trade town since the Middle Ages. To defend it against invasion from the sea, the [[Moors]] had built a stone castle on a hill between the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Fuengirola River]]. During the [[Peninsular War]] the area of [[Costa del Sol]] was considered of secondary importance and it was seized by the French forces with little opposition and until 1810 the partisan activity in the region was close to none. That is why, after suffering losses in the fights in the interior, some Polish units of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] were sent there in October 1810 to serve as a garrison and to rest.	|||	 Background 	|||		|||

While the [[Battle of Gaines's Mill|battle at Gaines's Mill]] raged north of the [[Chickahominy River]], the forces of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[John B. Magruder]] conducted a reconnaissance in force that developed into a minor attack against the [[Union Army|Union]] line south of the river at Garnett's Farm. The Confederates attacked again near Golding's Farm on the morning of June 28 but in both cases were easily repulsed. The action at the Garnett and Golding farms accomplished little beyond convincing McClellan that he was being attacked from both sides of the Chickahominy.	|||		|||		|||

The Axis distracted the British with a decoy attack in the north and made the main attack round the southern flank of the Gazala position. The advance succeeded but the defence of the French garrison of [[Bir Hakeim]] at the southern end of the line left the Axis with a long and vulnerable supply route behind the British line.	|||		|||		|||

1	Battle of Guillemont	|||	Western Front (World War I)	|||	Wilfrid Miles noted in the [[History of the Great War|British Official History]], that the defence of Guillemont was judged by some observers, to be the best performance of the war by the German army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. A pause in Anglo-French attacks at the end of August, to organise bigger combined attacks and postponements for bad weather, coincided with the largest counter-attack by the German army in the Battle of the Somme. Joffre, Foch and Haig abandoned attempts to organise large combined attacks, in favour of sequenced army attacks and the capture of the German defences from Cléry north of the Somme, to Guillemont from {{nowrap|3–6 September,}} brought the French Sixth and British Fourth armies onto ground which overlooked the German third position. Rain, congestion and reliefs of tired divisions then forced a pause in French attacks until 12 September. In the [[Battle of Ginchy]] (9 September) the Fourth Army captured the village, ready for the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]], (15–22 September).	|||		|||		|||

1	Bishops' Wars	|||	Wars of the Three Kingdoms	|||	The '''Bishops' Wars''' ({{lang-la|Bellum Episcopale}}) were conflicts, both political and military, which occurred in 1639 and 1640 centred on the nature of the governance of the [[Church of Scotland]], and the rights and powers of the Crown. They constitute part of a larger political [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|conflict across Scotland, England and Ireland]], and are often considered a prelude to the [[English Civil War]]s. They were so named due to the central conflict between [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], who favoured an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] system of church government for Scotland (that is, with bishops), and the desire of much of the polity of Scotland for a [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] system of governance (without bishops).	|||		|||		|||

1	Caesar's invasions of Britain	|||	Gallic Wars	|||	In the course of his [[Gallic Wars]], [[Julius Caesar]] invaded [[Great Britain|Britain]] twice: in 55 and 54 BC.  The first invasion, in late summer, may have been intended as a mere reconnaissance-in-force expedition, or as a full-scale invasion—but if it was an invasion, it was unsuccessful. It gained the Romans little else besides a beachhead on the coast of [[Kent]]. The second invasion achieved more: the Romans installed a king, [[Mandubracius]], who was friendly to Rome, and they forced the submission of Mandubracius's rival, [[Cassivellaunus]]. No territory was conquered and held for Rome; instead, all Roman-occupied territory was restored to the allied [[Trinovantes]], along with the promised tribute of the other tribes in what is now eastern England.	|||		|||		|||
1	Campaign in north-east France (1814)	|||	War of the Sixth Coalition	|||	The '''1814 campaign in north-east France''' was Napoleon's final campaign of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]]. Following their victory at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1813), Russian, Austrian and other German armies of the Sixth Coalition entered France. Despite the disproportionate forces in favour of the Coalition, Napoleon managed to inflict many defeats, especially during the [[Six Days Campaign]]. However, the Coalition kept heading towards Paris, which capitulated in March 1814. As a result, Napoleon was deposed and exiled to [[Elba]] and the victorious powers started to redraw the map of Europe during the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|First Treaty of Paris]] and during the early stages of the [[Congress of Vienna]].	|||		|||		|||
1	Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Northeast China	|||	Chinese Civil War	|||	'''Campaign to Suppress Bandits in [[Northeast China]]''' (东北剿匪) was a counterinsurgency / counter [[guerrilla]] campaign fought between the bandits turned guerrillas allied with [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|communists]] during [[Chinese Civil War]] in the post [[World War II]] era, and resulted in the [[communist]] victory.	|||		|||		|||

French Territorials fought the [[II Royal Bavarian Corps|II Bavarian Corps]] on the north bank of the Somme in late September 1914, after which the front line moved west past Lesbœufs. Little military activity occurred round the village until the beginning of the [[Battle of the Somme]], when German troops passed through the village in the first weeks of the battle. During the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] {{nowrap|(15–22 September),}} advances by the right flank corps of the British [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]], brought the front line forward to the {{lang|de|''Gallwitz Riegel''}} trenches west of Lesbœufs but exhaustion prevented the British from reaching their third objective, a line east of Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt.	|||		|||		|||
1	Capture of Martinpuich	|||	Battle of the Somme	|||	'''Martinpuich''' is situated {{convert|18|mi|km}} south of Arras, near the junction of the D 929 and D 6 roads, opposite Courcelette. The village lies south of [[Le Sars]], west of [[Flers, Somme|Flers]] and north-west of [[Attacks on High Wood|High Wood]]. In September 1914, during the [[Race to the Sea]], the divisions of the [[XIV Corps (German Empire)|XIV Corps]] advanced westwards, on the north bank of the Somme towards Albert and Amiens, passing through Martinpuich. The village became a backwater until 1916, when the British and French began the [[Battle of the Somme]] {{nowrap|(1 July – 13 November)}} and was the site of several air operations by the [[Royal Flying Corps]], which attacked German supply dumps in the vicinity.	|||		|||		|||
1	Capture of Oppy Wood	|||	Western Front (World War I)	|||	The '''Capture of Oppy Wood''' was an engagement on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[Great War]] on 28 June 1917.{{sfn|James|1924|p=19}} The [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] of 1917 ended with the Germans in possession of a fortified wood to the west of the [[commune]] of [[Oppy, Pas-de-Calais|Oppy]], which overlooked British positions. The wood was {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} in area and contained many German observation posts, machine-guns and trench-mortars. New German defensive tactics adopted after the Battle of the Somme, of defence in depth and rapid counter-attack, had been enforced on the German 6th Army after the disaster of 9 April. A British attack was defeated everywhere on 3 May, except at Fresnoy which was captured by the 1st Canadian Division. The attack on Oppy Wood by [[92nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|92nd Brigade]] of the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]] during the [[Third Battle of the Scarpe]] {{nowrap|(3–4 May),}} was repulsed with many British casualties. The area was defended by the 1st Guard Reserve Division and the 15th Reserve Division, which had not needed to call on specialist [[Eingreif division|Eingreif]] (counter-attack) divisions.	|||		|||		|||
1	Central Plains War	|||	Chinese Civil War	|||	After the Northeast Army's entrance to Central China, [[Manchuria]]'s defense was considerably weakened. It indirectly led to Japan's aggression in the [[Mukden Incident]]. In a wider view, this battle reflected the weakness behind the Nationalist government's unification.  The [[Kuomintang]] was unable to resolve internal disputes between the central government and the regional powers through political methods, and had to resort to military measures. Even though Chiang Kai-shek, who represented the central government, managed to achieve victory, the methods he used, including bribery of subordinates of the opposition, were not consistently effective. It did nothing to cement unity among the cliques in the party. The [[Xi'an Incident]] in 1936 and the collapse of the Kuomintang force in the [[Chinese Civil War]] are, to an extent, due the recurrence of this internal conflict.	|||	 Aftermath 	|||		|||
1	Colmar Pocket	|||	World War II	|||	The '''Colmar Pocket''' ({{lang-fr|Poche de Colmar}}; {{lang-de |Brückenkopf Elsaß}}) was the area held in central [[Alsace]], [[France]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|Nineteenth Army]] from November 1944 – February 1945, against the [[Sixth United States Army Group|U.S. 6th Army Group]] during [[World War II]]. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], but could not clear central Alsace. During [[Operation Nordwind]] in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the [[Saarland|Saar]] into northern Alsace. In late January and early February 1945, the [[French First Army]] (reinforced by the [[XXI Corps (United States)|U.S. XXI Corps]]) cleared the Pocket of German forces.	|||		|||		|||
1	Convoy SC 7	|||	World War II	|||	'''SC-7''' was the code name for a large Allied [[World War II]] [[convoy]] of 35 merchant ships and six escorts which sailed eastbound from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] for [[Liverpool]] and other [[United Kingdom]] ports on 5 October 1940. While crossing the Atlantic, the convoy was intercepted by one of the [[U-boat|German Navy's submarine]] [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]].

1	Convoys HX 229/SC 122	|||	World War II	|||	The battle around convoys '''HX 229''' and '''SC 122''' occurred during March 1943 in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]], and was the largest convoy battle of [[World War II]]. British merchant shipping was formed into [[convoy]]s for protection against German submarine attack. ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' tactics against convoys employed multiple-submarine [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics in nearly simultaneous surface attacks at night. Patrolling aircraft restricted the ability of submarines to converge on convoys during daylight. The North Atlantic winters offered the longest periods of darkness to conceal surfaced submarine operations. The winter of 1942–43 saw the largest number of submarines deployed to the mid-Atlantic before comprehensive anti-submarine aircraft patrols could be extended into that area.	|||		|||		|||

1	Dano-Swedish War (1657–58)	|||	Second Northern War	|||	The '''Dano-Swedish War of 1657–58''' was a conflict between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and [[Denmark–Norway]] during the [[Second Northern War]]. In 1657, [[Charles X of Sweden]] and his Swedish army were [[Deluge (history)|bogged down]] in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] saw this as an opportunity to recover [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|the territories lost in 1645]] and attacked Sweden.

[[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma's]] troops surrounded the city of [[Neuss]], an important Protestant garrison in the Electorate of Cologne.  After the city refused to capitulate, Parma's army reduced the city to rubble, through a combination of artillery fire, destructive house to house fighting, plundering; during the battle, a fire started that destroyed most of the rest of the city.

The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British [[Royal Navy]] forces who controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but could not make an impression on the fortresses defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders into submission with the support of a squadron of [[French Navy]] [[frigates]] operating off the coast.	|||		|||		|||

The only objective not in Axis hands was Sevastopol. Several attempts were made to secure the city in October and November 1941. A major attack was planned for late November, but heavy rains delayed the Axis attack until 17 December 1941. Under the command of [[Erich von Manstein]], Axis forces were unable to capture Sevastopol during this first operation. Soviet forces launched an amphibious landing on the Crimean peninsula at [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula (1942)|Kerch]] in December 1941 to relieve the siege and force the Axis to divert forces to defend their gains. The operation saved Sevastopol for the time being, but the bridgehead in the eastern Crimea was eliminated in May 1942.	|||		|||		|||
